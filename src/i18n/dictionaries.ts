A Personal session is the studio to yourself for 50 minutes, €30. A Duet is the same session shared with one other person, €45 for the two of you, bought and booked by one of you.\n\nBook by the end of the day before, so we can arrange an instructor for your session. The same deadline applies to cancelling: after it, somebody has already been asked to come in for you, and the session counts as used. These sessions are bought on their own and are valid only for those midday hours, so they are separate from any class pack you hold.",

          q: "Do sessions expire?",
          a: "Each pack carries a validity window, shown on the pack before you buy, and your account always shows the exact expiry date of every session you hold. They last until the end of that day, not until the hour you bought them.\n\nThe window covers the class as well as the booking: a 30-day pack books classes in those 30 days, not classes in three months' time. That is what makes 30 days mean 30 days of training rather than 30 days of shopping.",

          q: "What is the cancellation policy?",
          a: "Cancel at least 12 hours before the class starts and your session is returned to your balance instantly. Inside 12 hours, online cancellation is not available and the session is deducted. Personal and Duet appointments close earlier, at the end of the day before, because an instructor has been asked to come in for that slot.\n\nSessions are not refundable in money. Cancelling a class returns the session to your balance to use on another one; it is not a refund, and sessions that expire unused are not refunded or extended. If you decide to stop coming, whatever is left in your balance stays yours until its expiry date and cannot be paid back.",
