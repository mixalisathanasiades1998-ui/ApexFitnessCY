/**
 * Bring an existing database up to the current schema, on connect.
 *
 * Why this exists rather than "remember to run `npm run db:push`": every time
 * this project has grown a column, the change has landed in the repo and then
 * failed on a machine that had already been set up, because the schema lives in
 * the database and the database is not in the repo. A missing column is not a
 * cosmetic difference either — it is a crash on the homepage, which is exactly
 * what happened here with `service_opt_in_at`.
 *
 * So the app repairs its own shape. This is a small, additive, idempotent
 * migration: it only ever adds columns, tables and indexes that are absent, and
 * never drops, renames or rewrites anything. `npm run db:push` still works and
 * remains the tool for real schema changes; this is the safety net that means
 * pulling the repo and starting the server is enough.
 *
 * Each entry must match src/db/schema.ts exactly. When you add a column there,
 * add it here too.
