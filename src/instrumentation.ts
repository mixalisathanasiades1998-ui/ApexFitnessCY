/**
 * The server's own clock.
 *
 * Next.js calls `register()` once when the server starts. It is the only hook
 * that runs without a request, which makes it the only place a clock can live.
 *
 * Why the clock is needed: the reminder sweep used to be nudged by ordinary
 * traffic — any visit to the timetable pushed the queue along. That is fine as a
 * backstop and useless as a mechanism, and the evidence was thirteen reminders
 * sitting unsent in a real database, the oldest from the previous day, because
 * nobody had happened to load the right page in the right minute. A reminder
 * that depends on somebody visiting the site is not a reminder: the member it is
 * for is, by definition, not visiting the site.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * Why it knocks on its own front door instead of calling the function.
 *
 * Next compiles this file for **every** runtime, edge included, and it follows
 * every import — including a dynamic one, and including one hidden behind a
 * runtime check that correctly returns first. Importing the sweep from here
 * therefore dragged `web-push` into an edge bundle, which dragged in
 * `https-proxy-agent`, which needs Node's `http`, which edge does not have. The
 * result was `Module not found: Can't resolve 'http'` and every page returning
 * 500 on the dev server — while `next build` was perfectly happy, which is the
 * worst kind of difference to have between the two.
 *
 * So this file imports nothing. It sends an HTTP request to the route that
 * already exists for exactly this job, which is compiled for the node runtime
 * like any other route. Two things fall out of that, both good: the module graph
 * from here is empty and cannot break again, and the timer now exercises the
 * *same* code path as the scheduled call a production host will make, rather
 * than a second one that could quietly drift away from it.
