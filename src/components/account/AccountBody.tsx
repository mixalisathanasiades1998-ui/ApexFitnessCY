  /**
   * Where the page lands, and it is one rule with two halves.
   *
   * **Profile lands at the top.** Profile is not really a section somebody goes
   * looking for: it is the default, and it is what the member's own photograph
   * points at. Somebody opening their account came to see their balance, and the
   * balance is above everything. So Profile and plain `/account` behave
   * identically, which is what they mean identically.
   *
   * **Every other section puts the pill bar at the top of the screen**, directly
   * under the header, with the panel they asked for beneath it. Anything else
   * leaves the right pill highlighted below the fold, and the member concludes
   * the menu item did nothing.
   *
   * ---
   *
   * **Why it places itself twice.**
   *
   * One `requestAnimationFrame` and a smooth `scrollIntoView` was the old
   * version, and it was right in principle and unreliable in practice. The
   * target's position is measured one frame after mount, and things above it are
   * still settling: a web font swapping in, an avatar arriving, a reveal
   * animation finishing. The scroll then glides to a position that was true when
   * it started and is not true when it stops, landing tens or hundreds of pixels
   * off, and always by an amount that depends on how much history the member has,
   * which is why it can look fine on one account and wrong on another.
   *
   * So the placement is instant and then checked twice. Instant, because a
   * smooth scroll cannot be corrected while it is still gliding: measuring
   * mid-flight gives a number that is wrong in a different way. It is also the
   * better behaviour on a page the member is arriving at rather than already
   * reading, since animating down a page they never saw is theatre. Two later
   * passes measure where the bar actually ended up and nudge it if it has drifted
   * more than a few pixels, which is invisible when nothing moved.
   *
   * One known drift, and the reason the later passes exist at all: the header is
   * sticky and shrinks from 103 pixels to 71 once the page is scrolled, over a
   * CSS transition of about four tenths of a second. The document moves up by
   * those 32 pixels while the transition runs, so a measurement taken at the
   * start of it is wrong by up to 32 and a measurement taken during it is wrong
   * by some fraction of 32. The last pass is deliberately after the transition
   * has finished rather than inside it.
   *
   * The offset comes from the element's own `scroll-margin-top` rather than a
   * number repeated here, so the CSS that clears the sticky header stays the one
   * place that decides how much room the header needs.
