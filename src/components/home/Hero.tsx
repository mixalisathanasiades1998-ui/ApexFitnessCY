/**
 * The cover: a full-viewport photograph of a class with the type centred over
 * it. The header switches to its own centred-wordmark mode over this section
 * (see Header.tsx), so the composition reads as one piece.
 *
 * The photograph is cropped below the faces — nobody in it is identifiable.
 *
 * TYPE: both lines of the headline share one face — `font-wordmark`, set to
 * Marcellus, whose flared stems echo the wordmark's lettering. To try another,
 * change `--font-wordmark` and the <link> in layout.tsx; nothing else needs
 * touching. docs/type-preview.html renders the candidates at this size.
 *
 * Both lines are sized off the *viewport*, width and height together, rather
 * than off breakpoints: the type used to be centred in the whole viewport at a
 * fixed size, so on a laptop window the first line ran straight through the
 * lockup in the bar above it. Now the headline can never grow past a share of
 * the height available to it, and the spacer below the photograph keeps it
 * clear of the bar whatever the window does.
 *
 * The entrance is CSS keyframes with staggered delays. The hero is on the
 * critical path of every first visit, so it carries no animation library.
