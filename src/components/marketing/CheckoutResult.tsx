/**
 * The page a member lands on the moment a payment goes through.
 *
 * Two separate things can make the numbers here lie, and both are handled.
 *
 * 1. The count in the header lives in the site layout, and a client-side
 *    navigation keeps the layout it already has — so buying a pack used to
 *    leave the old number in the corner of the screen until a hard reload.
 *    One refresh on arrival re-renders the layout as well as this page.
 * 2. The provider sends the member back here the instant the card clears,
 *    which can be a moment before the webhook that actually grants the
 *    sessions has landed. While the balance still reads zero we keep
 *    re-checking rather than showing a wrong number.
