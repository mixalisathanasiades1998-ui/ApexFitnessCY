/**
 * The long terms, as one card with two choices in it.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * **Why these three and not all five.**
 *
 * A month and three months are cards on the page above, because those are the
 * plans somebody weighs up: they want to see the two prices next to each other
 * and decide. Six, nine and twelve months are not browsed that way. Nobody
 * arrives undecided between nine and twelve; they arrive having decided to
 * commit, and the useful thing then is to say how long and how often and be
 * told the price. Twelve cards to express that is twelve cards nobody reads.
 *
 * The first version of this card carried all five terms and replaced every
 * pricing card on the page, which went too far: it hid the two ordinary
 * choices behind a control. This is the same idea applied only where it helps.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * **It looks like a pricing card because it is one.**
 *
 * An earlier version was a wide two-column panel with the choices on the left
 * and the price on the right, and it read as a different kind of thing from
 * everything around it — a configurator bolted onto a price list. The studio
 * said so. So the card is the same card: same border, same radius, same
 * padding, same price size, same rows across the bottom, same button. The only
 * difference is that two of the lines in it are chips you can press.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * **It resolves to a pack rather than computing a price.**
 *
 * `slugFor` builds the slug — `half-2`, `year-4` — and looks it up in the
 * catalogue the server sent. Nothing here multiplies or discounts anything.
 *
 * That matters more than it looks. A builder doing its own arithmetic would be
 * a second pricing engine, and the moment the studio ran an offer through the
 * desk the card and the checkout would disagree about what something costs. The
 * price shown here is the priced pack, offer included, because it *is* the
 * pack. A combination with no pack behind it does not offer itself.
 */

/**
 * The three long terms, read from the catalogue rather than written again.
 *
 * They were a list in this file, which is one of two places the same fact would
 * then live: give `half` a row of cards on the page and forget to remove it
 * here, and the studio has a term sold twice with nothing complaining. Now
 * there is one list, in `packs.ts`, next to the one that decides which groups
 * get cards.
 */

/**
 * The four cadences — and the fourth one is not called the same thing in every
 * term, which is a trap worth spelling out.
 *
 * `half-4` is "6 months · Unlimited", with a one-a-day cap. `month-4` is
 * "Monthly · 4 a week", with no cap. Same `-4`, two different products. This
 * card only offers the long terms, where all four `-4` packs happen to be the
 * unlimited kind — but the label is still read off the pack rather than
 * assumed, because the first version of this card assumed and was wrong.
