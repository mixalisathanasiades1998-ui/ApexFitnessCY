/**
 * The desk's own top bar, in place of the website's.
 *
 * The tabs are the whole of the navigation here, and on a wide screen they sit
 * where a browser's tabs would: at the top, always in the same place, always
 * visible. Which tabs appear depends on who is signed in — reception has five,
 * the owner six. The bar sticks to the top of the window so that scrolling
 * down a long roster never means scrolling back up to change tab.
 *
 * The wordmark is deliberately not a link. There is nothing on the public site
 * the desk needs while it is working, and a logo that navigates away is a logo
 * that eventually loses somebody's half-finished notice.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * **Below `lg` the tabs become one button and a menu, and that is a fix rather
 * than a preference.**
 *
 * Six tabs, a 132px wordmark, a language toggle and a Log out button do not fit
 * across a phone. They used to be a horizontally scrolling row, which sounds
 * reasonable and is not: at 390px the row showed about two and a half pills, so
 * reaching Analytics meant swiping a strip of buttons that is 44px tall while
 * every pill under the thumb is a live navigation. Aiming at a target in a
 * scrolling container is the one interaction a thumb is worst at, and picking
 * the wrong tab at the desk means losing whatever was half typed.
 *
 * One button in the corner is a single fixed target, and the menu that opens
 * gives every section a full-width row. It also names the section you are in on
 * the button itself, which the scrolling row could not do once the live pill had
 * scrolled out of sight.
 *
 * Log out moves into the bottom of that menu, with the staff name and the
 * language toggle, because it is the one thing here nobody presses by accident
 * on purpose: on the old bar it sat next to the tabs at the same size, one
 * thumb-width from Analytics.
 *
 * The desktop row keeps `data-desk-tab`, which is what the desk suite reads to
 * check that reception's bar has no Pricing or Analytics on it. The menu rows
 * carry `data-desk-pick` instead, so a selector for one can never match both.
