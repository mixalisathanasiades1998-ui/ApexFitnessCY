/**
 * The one time the studio asks about notifications, and it asks after a booking.
 *
 * The permission lived only in the profile, on a screen a member visits once to
 * upload a photograph and then never again — so almost nobody had notifications
 * on, and the studio's ability to say "tonight's class is cancelled" reached
 * about as far as its ability to phone forty people.
 *
 * The moment to ask is the moment the answer means something. Somebody who has
 * just booked a class has, thirty seconds ago, expressed an interest in what
 * happens to that class: "shall we tell you if this changes?" is a question
 * about the thing in front of them, not a request for a permission in the
 * abstract. Which is also why the wording is about the class and not about
 * notifications.
 *
 * Asked once, and taking no for an answer:
 *
 *   - It appears after a booking, not on arrival. A prompt on page load is the
 *     thing every website does and every member dismisses, and Chrome now
 *     penalises a site whose prompts are repeatedly dismissed by refusing to
 *     show them at all — so a badly-timed ask does not merely fail, it burns
 *     the only chance there was.
 *   - "Not now" is remembered, in this browser, and this panel does not come
 *     back. Not on the account: the permission is per-device, so a member who
 *     said not now on their laptop should still be asked on their phone, where
 *     the answer is worth something. That is what makes localStorage the right
 *     store here rather than a column, and it is the only thing it is used for.
 *   - It never appears once the answer is known. Granted needs nothing;
 *     "denied" cannot be undone from a page — only the member, in their browser
 *     settings — and a panel that says "click allow" when no prompt will ever
 *     appear is the most irritating thing an app can do. The profile explains
 *     that case properly, and this points at it.
