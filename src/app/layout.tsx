/**
 * The fonts, self-hosted from the `@fontsource` packages instead of fetched from
 * Google at runtime.
 *
 * They used to load from a Google Fonts <link> with `display=swap`, which is
 * what made the headline flash on every fresh load: the browser painted a
 * fallback serif, fetched the real font from Google (a whole extra connection to
 * a third-party server), then swapped it in — the visible "correction". Serving
 * the woff2 files from our own domain instead collapses that fetch from hundreds
 * of milliseconds to tens, so the swap is effectively gone, and it removes the
 * dependency on Google being reachable at build or run time.
 *
 * Only the weights actually used, latin only — none of the three ship Greek
 * glyphs, so Greek text falls back to a system face exactly as it did before.

/**
 * There is deliberately no cookie banner here, and that is a decision rather
 * than an omission.
 *
 * This site sets no advertising, analytics or tracking cookie of any kind. What
 * it stores is the sign-in cookie, the desk's own lock, and the language the
 * visitor picked. The first two are strictly necessary, which is exempt from
 * consent; the third is only ever written the moment somebody clicks EN or EL,
 * which is the visitor asking for it, and interface preferences a visitor sets
 * themselves are exempt on the same footing (Article 29 Working Party opinion
 * 04/2012, the "UI customisation" case).
 *
 * So there is nothing here to ask permission for in advance. Not clicking the
 * language switch is the refusal. What is still owed is the telling, and that
 * is /cookies, linked in the footer under Legal, which names every cookie, what
 * it holds and how long it lasts.
 *
 * The one thing that could change this is Stripe: its script sets two of its
 * own cookies on the checkout page for fraud checks. Stripe treats them as
 * strictly necessary to take a payment, which is the ordinary reading. If a
 * lawyer disagrees, the banner comes back on that page and nowhere else.
