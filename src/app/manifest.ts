/**
 * The web app manifest, and the reason push did not work on iPhone.
 *
 * This file was missing, and everything else about notifications was in place:
 * the service worker, the VAPID keys, the enrolment button, the subscription
 * table. A member added the site to their Home Screen, opened it from the icon,
 * and no notification ever arrived.
 *
 * The cause is an Apple rule with no error message attached to it. iOS grants
 * web push only to a *home screen web app*, and what makes an icon a home
 * screen web app rather than a bookmark is a manifest declaring
 * `display: standalone`. Without one, Add to Home Screen produces something
 * that looks identical on the springboard and is, as far as notifications are
 * concerned, a Safari tab: `Notification.requestPermission` never resolves to
 * granted, `pushManager.subscribe` fails, and nothing in the browser says why.
 *
 * So: `display: standalone` is the load-bearing line here. The icons matter too
 * — iOS refuses to install without a 192 and a 512 — and everything else is
 * ordinary polish.
 *
 * A route rather than a static file because the name and the description come
 * from the same dictionary as the rest of the site, so they cannot drift from
 * what the pages say.
