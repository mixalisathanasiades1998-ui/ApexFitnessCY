/**
 * The card to put behind one link: an Instagram bio, a WhatsApp message, a QR
 * code on the counter.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * **Unlisted, not private.**
 *
 * Nothing links here. It is not in the header, not in the footer, and not in
 * `sitemap.ts`, which is an explicit list rather than a crawl. `robots.ts`
 * disallows it and the metadata below says `noindex, nofollow`, so it stays out
 * of Google.
 *
 * What it is not is secret. There is no password and no token in the address,
 * because the whole purpose is to hand the address to people. Anybody with the
 * link can open it, and it holds nothing that matters: the studio's own name,
 * its public social accounts and its published phone number. Treat it as a
 * printed card, which is what it is.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * **No header and no footer.**
 *
 * A page whose job is five buttons should not carry the site's navigation above
 * them: HOME, STUDIO, CLASSES, TIMETABLE and BOOK A CLASS are five more things
 * to press instead of the one thing the link was sent for. `Chrome` leaves this
 * route bare, the same way it does the reception desk.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * **Why this one is brown when the site is cream.**
 *
 * The cream wordmark exists for dark grounds and had nowhere to be used. More
 * usefully, a share card is seen once, out of context, usually next to somebody
 * else's link, and a coloured ground reads as deliberate there in a way that a
 * white page does not.
 *
 * The ground is `mocha-600`, `#5B4645`, flat. That is the primary brand brown,
 * the one the studio's own material is set on, sampled from it rather than
 * chosen. The first version of this page ran a gradient from `mocha-800` down
 * to `mocha-950` and was much too dark: further from the brand, and the kind of
 * near-black that reads as a different company. Cream on `#5B4645` measures
 * 7.5:1, so the lighter ground costs nothing in legibility.
