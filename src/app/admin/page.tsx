 * The desk console.

 * /admin is a door of its own. Nobody is bounced to the member sign-in page and
 * back: whoever arrives is asked for a staff email and password right here, and
 * that one form both signs them in and unlocks the desk. Staff already signed
 * in whose 15-minute idle window has lapsed are asked for the password alone.
 *
 * Until the door is open this page loads *nothing* — no member list, no
 * takings, no phone numbers. That is the point: a locked console that has
 * already fetched the data it is protecting is not locked, it is decorated.
 * A visitor who is signed in as a member sees the same sign-in form as a
 * stranger, so the page never confirms who does or does not work here.
