/**
 * The opening offer, handed over the moment the address is proved.
 *
 * This is where it belongs, and the reason is the one thing registration could
 * not know: that the person typing the address can read it. Granting at
 * registration meant a session and a congratulatory email for any address
 * somebody chose to type, including one belonging to a stranger, and for the
 * accounts the housekeeping sweep deletes seven days later for never confirming.
 *
 * Three things make this safe to run inside a request:
 *
 *   - It runs once per account. `checkCode` returns `ALREADY` for an account
 *     that is verified, and that path returns before reaching here, so the
 *     transition from unverified to verified happens exactly once.
 *   - It is belt-and-braces idempotent anyway. Accounts verified before this
 *     moved already hold their batch, and the check below finds it. The
 *     condition is the batch's own spend window, which no other grant shares.
 *   - It can never fail the verification. Somebody who typed the right code is
 *     verified whatever happens to a promotional grant; a missing free session
 *     is ten seconds of the desk's time, a member locked out of their own
 *     account by a failed bonus is not.
