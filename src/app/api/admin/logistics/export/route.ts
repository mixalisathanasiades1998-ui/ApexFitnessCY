/**
 * The period's sales, as a spreadsheet the accountant can open.
 *
 * Owner only, and for the same reason the takings screen is: this is money the
 * studio took, name by name. A GET rather than a POST because a browser can only
 * be made to save a file by navigating to a URL, and a navigation is a GET — the
 * panel points `window.location` here and the `Content-Disposition: attachment`
 * turns the response into a download rather than a page.
 *
 * No Stripe fee column: the fee lives only in Stripe and only on the online
 * rows. The studio pulls that from the Stripe dashboard and sets it against the
 * online total here. This file is the book of record for what was sold; Stripe's
 * report is the record of what it cost to bank the card share of it.
