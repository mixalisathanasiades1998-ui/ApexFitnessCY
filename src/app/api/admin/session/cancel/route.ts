/**
 * Call off one class, from the desk.
 *
 * The studio is opening late, closing early, or a reformer is down for the
 * morning: one hour has to come off the timetable and the people booked into it
 * put back where they were. Unlike closing a whole day, which is the owner's
 * call, this is a `desk()` action — an instructor reporting the fault is the
 * ordinary way it starts. See `cancelSession` for the rules; they are the
 * day-closure's rules applied to a single slot.
 *
 * Every affected member is told, after the cancellation has committed, that
 * their class is off and their session is back. Fired and not awaited, exactly
 * as a booking's own cancellation is: the refund is already done in the
 * database, and a slow mail server must not hold up the desk's next action.
