 * A reminder has to go out at two hours before the class whether or not anybody
 * happens to be looking at the website, so something outside the app has to
 * knock on this door — a hosting provider's scheduler, or Windows Task
 * Scheduler. Every five minutes is plenty: the sweep sends everything that has
 * come due, so a missed run catches up on the next one rather than losing
 * anybody's reminder.
 *
 * Two ways in, and no third: the shared secret for a machine, or a signed-in
 * member of staff for a person testing it. Left open, this would be a way for
 * anyone to make four hundred phones buzz.
 *
 * It also carries the housekeeping: registrations nobody finished, and dead
 * confirmation codes. See `housekeeping()` at the bottom for why they live here
 * rather than in a second scheduled job.
