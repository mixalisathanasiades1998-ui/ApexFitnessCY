/**
 * Reception taking a booking over the telephone.
 *
 * The studio's reason for wanting this is worth writing down, because it shapes
 * the rules: a class with three people in it and another with one is a Tuesday
 * that could have been two full classes, and the fix is somebody at the desk
 * ringing round to ask whether the member with the quiet class can come to the
 * busy one. That call ends with "yes, put me in", and until now there was no way
 * to put them in.
 *
 * **It books under the member's own rules, not the desk's.** This is the whole
 * design of it, and it was a decision rather than the easy path: `bookClass` is
 * called exactly as the member's own screen calls it, so a session comes out of
 * the package that expires soonest, a group session cannot pay for a noon
 * appointment, a full class is still full, the one-a-day cap on the Unlimited
 * plan still applies, and a member with nothing left is refused.
 *
 * The alternative — a desk that can book without spending anything, or with an
 * override for the member who has run out — is more convenient about twice a
 * month and wrong every day after that. The balance on the member's screen stops
 * matching what they have actually used, and the first person to notice is a
 * member who counted differently from the studio. Reception can already sell
 * sessions in ten seconds; a member who wants a class and has none should buy
 * one, and that conversation is a better outcome for the studio than a free
 * class nobody recorded.
 *
 * Two things it deliberately does *not* inherit. The cancellation window is not
 * one of them, because cancelling is `cancelForMember` and that one does
 * override the window: the difference is that a late cancellation is the desk
 * exercising judgement about a member who rang with a reason, while a booking
 * paid for by nothing is the desk creating money.
