 * Personal and duet sessions, in one place.

 * These are not classes with a smaller cap. They are appointments, and almost
 * every rule about them differs from the timetable above them:
 *
 *   - they sit in the midday gap, 12:00, 13:00 and 14:00, weekdays only, in the
 *     three hours the studio is otherwise shut between the morning and the
 *     evening rota;
 *   - one reformer and one instructor, so one booking and no waiting list;
 *   - booking closes at the end of the previous day, because somebody has to be
 *     asked to come in and teach it and nobody can be asked at eleven for noon;
 *   - they are paid for with a personal or duet session, which cannot buy a
 *     group class, and no group session can buy one of these;
 *   - a duet is one appointment for two people on one session, booked by one
 *     member who names the person coming with them.
 *
 * Everything above is expressed here or in `packs.ts`. Nothing about them is
 * inferred from the hour or the capacity anywhere else in the app, because an
 * inference like that is right until the studio moves the slot.
