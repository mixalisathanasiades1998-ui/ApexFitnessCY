 * password reset. A long-lived session cookie is the right trade for booking a

 * which is the wrong shape twice over. It shut the console on somebody in the
 * middle of serving a queue, and it left an abandoned counter open for up to
 * three quarters of an hour. Both of those are the same mistake: measuring the
 * wrong thing.
 *
 * So the window is now short and it slides. Every desk action pushes it out
 * again — see `touchDesk` — so reception working through a morning is never
 * interrupted, and a counter nobody has touched for a quarter of an hour asks
 * for the password. Shorter *and* less annoying, which is unusual enough to be
