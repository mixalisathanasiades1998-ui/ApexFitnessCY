 * The invoice for one purchase, gathered from the database and drawn.

 * One function, three callers: the confirmation email attaches what it returns,
 * the member downloads it from their account, and the desk downloads it from a
 * member's card. Having them share this rather than each assemble their own
 * `InvoiceData` is the difference between one invoice and three documents that
 * disagree about what somebody bought.
 *
 * Returns null when there is nothing to draw — no such purchase, or one that has
 * not been paid. Never throws for those: two of the three callers are showing
 * somebody a page, and a missing invoice is a 404, not a stack trace.
