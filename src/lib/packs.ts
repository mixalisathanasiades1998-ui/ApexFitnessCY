 * two plans people actually buy — a month and a term — stopped being things you
 * could see and compare, and became something you had to operate a control to
 * find out about.
 *
 * So the split is by how the decision is made, not by how many cards it costs.
 * A month and three months are the ordinary choices, so they are cards you can
 * read side by side. Six, nine and twelve months are the same product bought
 * for longer, and nobody browses those: somebody arrives already knowing they
 * want a year, and one control is a better way to say so than twelve cards.
 *
 * **And the appointments moved to the bottom.** Personal and Duet sat at the
 * top with the day pass under "One at a time", which is true and put the two
 * most expensive per-session things on the page in front of everything else.
 * They are a different product for a different reason, they cost more per hour
 * than any plan costs per class, and leading with them makes the studio look
 * expensive before anybody has seen what a class costs.

  /* ------------------------------------------------- personal and duet
     A different thing from the plans above, sold in the same currency, and
     grouped on the price list with the day pass rather than alone at the foot
     of it.

     They belong there because all three are the same purchase: one session,
     thirty days, no commitment. The day pass buys a place in a class, a
     Personal buys the room, a Duet buys it for two — and a visitor deciding
     "I want to try one thing" is choosing between exactly those three. It also
     fixes a layout that had one lonely card under one heading and two under
     another.

     The old comment here worried that sitting near the plans would make a one
     to one look like a bad deal on price per session. That was right, and it is
     why they are not in the Monthly or 3 months rows. Next to the day pass the
     comparison is honest: EUR 20 for a class, EUR 30 for the room, EUR 22.50
     each for two.

     One reformer, one instructor, and the studio's midday hours: 12:00, 13:00
     and 14:00, weekdays. An appointment rather than a class, so it is booked by
     the end of the previous day — somebody has to be asked to come in and teach
     it — and the session that pays for it cannot pay for anything else.

     Thirty days rather than ninety, because these are bought for a reason that
     has a date on it: a return after an injury, a technique that is not working,
     a week before a wedding. A one to one still sitting in a balance in March
     was not what anybody meant to buy in January. */
