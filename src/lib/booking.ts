 * Cancel button that refuses them — with no way to say so, and their name on a
 * roster the instructor will read out to an empty reformer. The studio asked for
 * it to be possible, and the reasoning above is what makes the shape obvious:
 * the session is genuinely gone, so the member has to be *told* that and has to
 * agree to it. Hence `forfeit`, which the caller only sets after the member has
 * confirmed those exact words on screen.
 *
 * And the spot is not always unrefillable — the studio can offer it to somebody,
 * and cannot offer what it does not know is free. That is the part that was
 * being thrown away to protect a member from a loss they had already taken.
 *
 * `forfeit` is deliberately not a default. Without it this behaves exactly as
