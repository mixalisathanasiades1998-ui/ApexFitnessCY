/**
 * Bring the generated timetable in line with the studio's actual room.
 *
 * The number of reformers and the length of a class are studio facts, not
 * per-class ones, but they are copied onto every generated class row. So a
 * database seeded when the studio was described as 50 minutes and eight places
 * keeps serving those numbers to the timetable for as long as those rows exist,
 * however many times the constants are corrected in code. This is not
 * hypothetical: the studio corrected the class length from an hour to fifty
 * minutes after six weeks of classes had already been generated.
 *
 * Rather than make people remember to re-seed, this repairs the data on the
 * first read after boot:
 *
 *   - every class from the start of today onwards is corrected, because that
 *     is the whole window the timetable shows. A class that finished two hours
 *     ago is still on today's page, and leaving it on the old rota was enough
 *     to make the entire class type read 50 minutes;
 *   - capacity is never dropped below the number of people already booked, so
 *     nobody is silently un-booked;
 *   - earlier days are left exactly as they were, because they are history.
 *
 * It is idempotent and costs one indexed UPDATE per process, so it is safe to
 * call from anywhere that reads the schedule.
