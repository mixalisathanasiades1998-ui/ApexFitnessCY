 * The words, in both languages.

 * likely to read Greek as English, and we do not ask them which, so an email
 * carries both. The second is that the same sentence goes to three different
 * places — the account, an inbox, a phone — and they must not be allowed to
 * drift apart into three slightly different accounts of the same fact.
 *
 * Where each language goes:
 *
 *   in the app   both are stored; the site shows whichever the member is
 *                reading it in, because it already knows that
 *   email        both, English above Greek, separated by a rule — we have no
 *                idea which they prefer and guessing wrong is worse than
 *                showing two
 *   push         one language, the member's own — see `say` below. A phone
 *                notification is one line and there is no room for two.
 *   sms          the same, and for the same reason, only harder: Greek costs
 *                three times the segments, so length is checked after the
 *                language is chosen and not before.

 * top of every page to read the site in Greek got a Greek copy of a message in
 * their account and an English copy of the same message on their phone, which
 * is worse than either alone: it looks like the studio does not know which
 * language it speaks to them in.
 *
 * The argument takes the raw column rather than a `Locale`, so every caller can
 * pass `user.locale` straight from a query without a cast or a check. Anything
 * that is not exactly "el" means English, which covers null, an old row, and a
 * value somebody typed by hand — the safe direction, because English is the
