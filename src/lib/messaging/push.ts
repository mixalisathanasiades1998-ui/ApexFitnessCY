 *
 * There is no company in the middle to sign up with — the message goes straight
 * to Google's, Apple's or Mozilla's push service, signed with our own keys. What
 * we cannot do is make it mandatory. The browser asks the member for permission
 * and the member, or their operating system, can withdraw it at any time
 * without telling us. So "push is always on" is a promise about *our* side: we
 * never turn it off for them and there is no switch to turn it off. Whether a
 * given phone actually rings is between the member and their phone.
 *
 * Two consequences worth knowing:
 *  - A member with no granted permission has no subscription row, so push
 *    simply skips them. They still get the notice in the app.
 *  - On iPhone, web push only works once the site has been added to the Home
 *    Screen. Until then Safari will not even offer the permission prompt.

   * environment panel while waiting for the real keys is exactly that: present,
   * and not a key. Left to throw, it took down every request that touched push —
   * which on a page load means a 500 in the console and a member who cannot
   * register, for the sake of a notification.
   *
   * Push is the most optional thing this site does. An unusable key means push
   * is off, said once in the log, and nothing else changes: members still get
   * every notice in the app, and the reminders still send by email. Treating a
   * bad key as "off" rather than as "fail" is the only proportionate answer.
