/**
 * Email through a mailbox the studio already owns.
 *
 * The other two transports (Resend, Brevo) are companies you sign up with, and
 * they need the sending *domain* verified with DNS records before they will send
 * anything. That is the right answer eventually and the wrong answer on a
 * Tuesday afternoon, because it means editing DNS and waiting.
 *
 * This one needs neither. It signs in to an ordinary mailbox — the same
 * credentials a mail client would use — and hands the message over. Nothing
 * about the domain changes, no records are added, and there is no third company
 * holding a copy of every email the studio sends.
 *
 *   EMAIL_PROVIDER=smtp
 *   SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
 *   SMTP_PORT=465
 *   SMTP_USER=info@apexfitnesscentrecy.com
 *   SMTP_PASS=<app password, not the account password>
 *   EMAIL_FROM="APEX pilates <info@apexfitnesscentrecy.com>"
 *
 * The honest limits, because they decide whether this stays or is replaced:
 *
 *   - A mailbox is not a bulk sender. Google allows roughly 2,000 messages a
 *     day on a Workspace account and throttles bursts, so a one-off announcement
 *     to 400 members is near the edge of what it will tolerate and a mistake
 *     that sends twice is over it. Booking and payment confirmations — a handful
 *     an hour — are comfortably inside it.
 *   - `SMTP_USER` and `EMAIL_FROM` must be the same mailbox. Mail servers refuse
 *     to send as somebody else, which is the one thing standing between all of
 *     us and a world of forged email. An alias the mailbox owns is fine.
 *   - The password must be an **app password**, not the account's own. Google
 *     rejects the real one outright.
 *
 * Written against the protocol rather than a library, so there is nothing to
 * install and nothing to keep up to date. SMTP is a conversation in short lines,
 * and the whole of it is below. Every failure returns the server's own words —
 * `535 Username and Password not accepted` is a far more useful thing to read
 * than "send failed".
