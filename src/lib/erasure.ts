/**
 * The right to be forgotten, done without forgetting the accounts.
 *
 * A member can require the studio to erase their personal data, and in the EU
 * that is not a favour — it is Article 17, and the studio has a month to do it.
 * The obvious implementation is `delete from users where id = ?`, and it is
 * wrong twice over.
 *
 * It is wrong legally. Every payment that member ever made is an accounting
 * record, and the studio keeps those for seven years and then archives them for
 * a further seven, fourteen in all; the obligation to keep them is itself a
 * lawful basis that survives the erasure request. Deleting the person is
 * required, deleting the invoice is not permitted.
 *
 * And it is wrong practically. Nine tables cascade off `users` — bookings,
 * purchases, credit batches, the credit ledger, reminders, notice reads, push
 * subscriptions, the avatar. A delete takes all of it, and because the owner's
 * revenue figures are a `sum(purchases.amount_cents)`, one erasure would quietly
 * rewrite last March's takings. A studio cannot have a button that changes its
 * own history.
 *
 * So the row stays and the person leaves it. Name, email, phone, date of birth,
 * height, weight and the instructor's notes are overwritten; the photograph and
 * every registered device are deleted; the password is replaced with something
 * nobody holds. What remains is an account with no human attached to it, still
 * carrying its payments and its attendance — which is exactly the shape the law
 * asks for.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * **What this deliberately does not do.**
 *
 * It does not cancel their upcoming classes. Somebody may want their data gone
 * and their Thursday class kept, and guessing wrong in either direction is worse
 * than telling the desk how many bookings are standing and letting a person
 * decide. The count comes back in the result for exactly that reason.
 *
 * It does not touch `serviceOptInAt`. That column is the record that consent was
 * given, on a date — evidence the studio may need precisely *because* somebody
 * is now disputing their relationship with it. A date on an anonymous row
 * identifies nobody.
 *
 * It does not run for reception, and it does not run for the studio's own
 * accounts. See the two refusals below.
