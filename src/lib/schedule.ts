 * number of weeks asked for and writes a real class for every day a template
 * falls on, which is what puts it on the timetable.
 *
 * Times are studio wall-clock times, so a 06:00 template produces a class at
 * 06:00 in Nicosia no matter what timezone the server runs in.
 *
 * **Idempotent, which is the important property.** (templateId, startsAt) is
 * unique, so running it twice never doubles a class up: the second run reports
 * everything as skipped and changes nothing. Pressing the button by accident is
 * therefore not a mistake that needs undoing — but the ids of what it did create
 * are returned anyway, so that a run which went further ahead than intended can
 * be taken back. See `removeGeneratedSessions`.

/**
 * Keep the far end of the timetable full, without anybody remembering to.
 *
 * `generateSessions` writes a fixed number of weeks from *today*, which means
 * the horizon does not move on its own: every day that passes, the last
 * bookable day gets one day closer, and after three months of nobody pressing
 * Generate at the desk the timetable simply stops. That was survivable while
 * the page showed four weeks of a six-week horizon — two weeks of slack nobody
 * saw. It is not survivable now the page shows the whole ninety days, because
 * the shortfall is on screen as a run of empty days at the end of the strip.
 *
 * The page's own window is computed from today on every request, so it already
 * advances daily: today it ends on 1 December, tomorrow on the 2nd. This is what
 * keeps the *classes* level with it.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * **Once per studio day, and the marker is a date rather than a countdown.**
 *
 * The obvious implementation compares the furthest class against the horizon and
 * generates when it falls short. It does not work, and the way it fails is
 * instructive: the studio is shut on Sundays, so the furthest class is often a
 * day or two behind the furthest *day*, and a naive comparison finds itself
 * permanently short — generating, creating nothing, and finding itself short
 * again on the next sweep, forever.
 *
 * So the question asked here is not "how far ahead are we" but "have we already
 * done this today". That cannot spin: it runs once, sets the marker, and does
 * nothing for the rest of the day. Generation is idempotent and skips everything
 * that already exists, so the cost of the one run is a single transaction of
 * about eight hundred no-ops — a few milliseconds, once a day.
 *
 * The marker lives in memory, which means a restart earns one extra run. That is
 * the right trade: an extra idempotent run costs nothing, and the alternative is
 * a row in the database to remember something that does not matter.
