/**
 * The studio's own invoice: who is issuing it, at what rate, and numbered how.
 *
 * A Stripe receipt is not a VAT invoice. It shows what was charged and to which
 * card, and says nothing about tax — no VAT number, no net-and-VAT breakdown,
 * nothing an accountant can put through a set of books. Stripe *can* issue real
 * invoices, but only through its own hosted Checkout flow, which would mean
 * sending members to a page at stripe.com and giving up the card fields in our
 * own page. So the studio issues its own, which has the side benefit of being
 * ours: bilingual if it needs to be, in the studio's own words, and available
 * for a cash sale that Stripe never sees.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * **Everything identifying the business is configuration, not code.**
 *
 * The legal name, the address, the VAT number and the rate are read from the
 * environment. They are facts about a company, they were not known when this
 * was written, and they will change — a rate rises, a company re-registers, an
 * address moves. Putting them in a file would mean a deploy to correct a
 * typo on a legal document.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * **The specimen guard, which is the important part of this file.**
 *
 * Until the real details arrive, the values here are placeholders. A document
 * carrying a made-up VAT number, sent to a real member who forwards it to a
 * real accountant, is not a rough draft — it is a false tax document with the
 * studio's name on it. So anything that is not demonstrably a real
 * configuration produces a SPECIMEN: stamped as one, numbered as one, and never
 * drawn from the real invoice sequence.
 *
 * That is also why a specimen is not simply refused. The studio needs to look
 * at the layout, the wording and the arithmetic today, with the numbers it will
 * have next week — it just must not be able to hand one to a client by
 * accident.
