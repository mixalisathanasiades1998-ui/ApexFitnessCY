 * A closure is a statement about a *day in Larnaca* — the 15th of August, the
 * fortnight in July — not about an instant in time, so it is stored as the
 * studio's own calendar day and compared that way. That keeps it right whether
 * the server runs in Cyprus or in UTC.
 *
 * Closing a day is not a soft thing: every booking on it is cancelled and the
 * session goes back to the member, even inside the 24-hour window, because it
 * is the studio that changed its mind and not the member. The classes are
 * marked cancelled so the timetable stops offering them, and reception gets the
 * list of everyone affected so they can be told.
