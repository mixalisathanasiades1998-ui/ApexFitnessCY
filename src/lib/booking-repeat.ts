/**
 * "Book my Monday ten o'clock for the next seven weeks."
 *
 * The studio sells three-month packs and members train on a fixed slot: the same
 * class, the same hour, the same two days a week, for a term. Booking that a
 * class at a time meant twenty-four visits to the timetable, and the studio was
 * asked for something better within a week of the packs going on sale.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * **What counts as "the same class".**
 *
 * Same class type, same weekday, same wall-clock start. Not the same instructor:
 * the rota is the studio's business and changes weeks ahead of a class, and a
 * member repeating their Monday slot is asking for the slot, not for Andreas.
 *
 * Matched on the studio's own weekday and minutes rather than by adding seven
 * days repeatedly, which is the same thing until a clock change: Cyprus moves in
 * late October, so a naive "+7 days" from September lands an hour out for the
 * back half of a twelve-week booking, and the member's Monday 10:00 becomes a
 * Monday 09:00 they never asked for.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * **Every week is booked on its own terms, and a refusal is not a failure.**
 *
 * This is a loop over `bookClass`, deliberately. Every rule that protects one
 * booking has to protect all of them: the capacity of the room, the sessions in
 * hand, the day limit on an Unlimited plan, the expiry date of a pack that runs
 * out in week nine. Reimplementing any of that here would be a second copy of
 * the rules, and a second copy is one that will eventually disagree.
 *
 * So the honest answer is a partial one. "Booked six of seven; the 24th is
 * full" is useful. Refusing all seven because one is full is not, and neither is
 * booking six and saying nothing about the seventh.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * **Group classes only.**
 *
 * An appointment is not repeatable from here and that is a studio decision, not
 * a missing feature. Every Personal or Duet hour commits somebody to come in and
 * teach it, arranged by hand the day before; twelve of them booked in one press
 * is twelve instructor hours the studio has promised without anybody at the desk
 * seeing it happen. Those stay one at a time.
