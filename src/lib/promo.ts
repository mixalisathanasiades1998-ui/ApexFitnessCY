/**
 * The opening offer, in one place.
 *
 * One free session for every account created between `grantFrom` and
 * `grantUntil`, spendable only on classes inside `spendFrom`…`spendUntil`.
 *
 * Everything about the campaign lives here on purpose. The alternative — a
 * `2026-09-20` written into the registration route, another into the booking
 * rules, a third into the copy — is four places to remember and three of them
 * will be missed the next time the studio runs an offer. Which it will: there is
 * always a Christmas.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * **Two different dates, and they are not the same thing.**
 *
 *   expiresAt     the last moment the session can be *spent*
 *   spendUntil    the last class it can be spent *on*
 *
 * The credit system already understood the first and not the second, and without
 * the second the offer does not work: a member granted a free session on the 1st
 * could spend it on the 2nd to book a class in November. The free session would
 * leak straight into the paid schedule and the opening-week constraint would mean
 * nothing. See `spendOneCredit`, which now takes the class date for exactly this.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * **If the month fills up, widen it here.**
 *
 * The offer ran for one week when it was written and now runs for the whole of
 * September, which is roughly four times the seats: the rota puts about 300
 * seats a week into the schedule, so the month holds something over a thousand.
 * One free session each is comfortable at that size. If it does run out, moving
 * `spendUntil` and `expiresAt` later is a one-line change and no member loses
 * anything by it. That escape hatch is the reason the dates are constants
 * rather than a hard-coded string.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * **When the session is actually handed over.**
 *
 * Not at registration. See `promoForJoin` at the bottom of this file: the offer
 * is decided by the date the account was *created* and granted the moment the
 * emailed code is typed back. Registering inside the window and confirming
 * afterwards still qualifies, so nothing is lost by the delay, and an address
 * that never confirms is never given anything.
