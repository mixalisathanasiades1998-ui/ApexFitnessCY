/**
 * The timetable's own shape, repaired on the first read after boot.
 *
 * Two structural facts about the studio changed at once, and both of them live
 * in rows rather than in code, so neither could be fixed by editing a constant.
 *
 * **One class, one name.** The rota was seeded with six class types —
 * Foundations, Flow, Sculpt, Jumpboard, Restore, Athletic — and the studio does
 * not teach six different things. It teaches Reformer Flow, and a member reading
 * six names was being asked to choose between distinctions the room does not
 * make. The templates are moved onto Flow, the classes still to come are moved
 * with them, and the other five are withdrawn.
 *
 * Days already past are left alone. A member's history saying they attended
 * Reformer Sculpt in July is true, and rewriting it would be the site editing
 * somebody's own record to match a decision taken afterwards.
 *
 * **The midday appointments.** Personal and duet sessions need a class type of
 * their own and fifteen weekly slots, and neither can be a constant either: the
 * generator reads templates out of the database. So they are written in here,
 * matched on the day and the hour, and adding them is a no-op on the second run.
 *
 * Idempotent, cheap, and reported so a boot that changed something says so.

     * bookings. And the studio's rota genuinely changed: from one uniform weekday
     * shape, open six days a week, to a per-day schedule with a named instructor
     * for each hour, closed on Saturday and Sunday. Adding the new hours was not
     * enough — the old hours the studio no longer runs (Saturday classes, the
     * old uniform afternoons) were still in the table, still generating classes a
     * member could see and book at a time the studio is shut, and every class
     * still carried whichever instructor first taught it.
     *
     * So the rota is reconciled, not merely topped up:
     *
     *   - every hour the rota calls for exists as a group template, with the
     *     instructor the rota names for that hour;
     *   - a group template at an hour the rota no longer mentions is switched
     *     off — this is a weekly recurring slot, which the rota owns; a one-off
     *     class the desk adds for a single date is a session, not a template, so
     *     it is untouched by this;
     *   - the future classes are brought with the templates: those at a dropped
     *     hour are removed if nobody has booked them, and the rest have their
     *     instructor set back to whoever the rota now names.
     *
     * Days already past are never touched: a class that has happened is history.
