/**
 * The timetable's own shape, repaired on the first read after boot.
 *
 * Two structural facts about the studio changed at once, and both of them live
 * in rows rather than in code, so neither could be fixed by editing a constant.
 *
 * **One class, one name.** The rota was seeded with six class types —
 * Foundations, Flow, Sculpt, Jumpboard, Restore, Athletic — and the studio does
 * not teach six different things. It teaches Reformer Flow, and a member reading
 * six names was being asked to choose between distinctions the room does not
 * make. The templates are moved onto Flow, the classes still to come are moved
 * with them, and the other five are withdrawn.
 *
 * Days already past are left alone. A member's history saying they attended
 * Reformer Sculpt in July is true, and rewriting it would be the site editing
 * somebody's own record to match a decision taken afterwards.
 *
 * **The midday appointments.** Personal and duet sessions need a class type of
 * their own and fifteen weekly slots, and neither can be a constant either: the
 * generator reads templates out of the database. So they are written in here,
 * matched on the day and the hour, and adding them is a no-op on the second run.
 *
 * Idempotent, cheap, and reported so a boot that changed something says so.
