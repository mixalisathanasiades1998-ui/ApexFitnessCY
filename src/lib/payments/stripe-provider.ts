/**
 * Stripe, with the card fields inside our own page.
 *
 * This is a Payment Intent rather than a Checkout Session, and the difference
 * is the whole point: a Checkout Session sends the member to a page at
 * stripe.com, while an intent hands back a one-time secret that the Payment
 * Element uses to talk to Stripe directly from the browser. The card number
 * never touches this server, so the studio stays out of PCI scope, and the
 * member never leaves apexpilates.
 *
 * Payment methods are card, Apple Pay and Google Pay. The last two are not
 * separate methods to Stripe — they are cards presented by a wallet — so asking
 * for `card` is what enables all three, and excludes everything else.
 *
 * The one exception is 3-D Secure. When the bank wants the member to confirm,
 * Stripe takes over the screen for a moment and then returns to `returnUrl`.
 * That is the bank's requirement, not a design choice, and it is the same for
 * every provider.
