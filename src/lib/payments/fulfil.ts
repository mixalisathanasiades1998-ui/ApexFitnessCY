/**
 * The one place a payment turns into sessions.
 *
 * Three different things can report the same successful payment: the provider's
 * webhook, the member's browser coming back from the card form, and a later
 * check from the account page. Each of them calls this, and it must be safe to
 * call twice a second apart from two different requests.
 *
 * How it is made safe: the purchase row is the lock. The status moves
 * PENDING -> PAID inside a transaction, and the update is conditional on the
 * row still being PENDING, so whichever caller gets there first is the one that
 * grants the batch. The others see zero rows changed and do nothing.
 *
 * (SQLite through better-sqlite3 is synchronous and single-writer, which makes
 * this airtight here. The conditional update is what carries the guarantee, so
 * it stays correct on a server with real concurrency too.)
