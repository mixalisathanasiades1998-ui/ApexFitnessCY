   * And the class has to fall inside the window too, not just the booking.
   *
   * This was the bug underneath the bug. `expiresAt` governed when a session
   * could be *spent* and nothing governed what it could be spent *on*, so a
   * member could buy a 30-day pack, wait until day 29, and book classes across
   * November and December. Thirty days then constrained the shopping and not the
   * training: the pack became unlimited in horizon, and seats came out of a
   * timetable the studio had not started selling.
   *
   * The mechanism already existed for the opening-week offer, which is exactly
   * this question asked about a promotion. So an ordinary pack now carries the
   * same upper bound as its own expiry, and `usableFrom` stays null because
   * there is no lower one: a session bought today is good for a class tonight.
   *
   * A batch with no expiry keeps no window either, which is right. Nothing
   * limits a session that never dies.
