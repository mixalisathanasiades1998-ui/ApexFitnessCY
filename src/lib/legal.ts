/**
 * The terms, the privacy notice and the cookie notice, in both languages.
 *
 * These used to live inside `components/marketing/LegalBody.tsx`, which was fine
 * for as long as the only place anybody read them was the page. Sign-up now asks
 * members to accept them before the account is created, and it has to show them
 * the same words: a checkbox saying "I accept the terms" next to a link that
 * opens a different document is not consent to anything.
 *
 * So the text is here and the page is one of three readers. There is exactly one
 * copy of it, and no reader can drift from another.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * **The facts are interpolated, not retyped.**
 *
 * The studio's address, mailbox, telephone number, class length, room capacity,
 * cancellation window and minimum age all come from the modules that already
 * hold them. A privacy notice that names an email address the studio no longer
 * uses is worse than no notice, and that is exactly what happens to a document
 * with the facts typed into it: the mailbox changed once already this month and
 * fifteen files had to be found.
 *
 * Every module read from here is import-pure. `legal.ts` is pulled into the
 * browser by the page and by the sign-up modal, so a constant imported from
 * something that touches the database would fail the build.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * **NOT LEGAL ADVICE, and the honest version of that warning.**
 *
 * These are written to describe what this software actually does: what it
 * stores, what it deletes, when it deletes it, and what an erasure really
 * removes. Every retention period and every named processor below was checked
 * against the code, not assumed. That makes them a far better starting point
 * than the placeholders they replace, and it does not make them a lawyer's
 * work.
 *
 * What a Cyprus lawyer should still check before launch, because none of it can
 * be read out of the code: the legal entity's registered name and number, the
 * VAT position, whether the six-year accounting retention below is the right
 * figure for this business, the liability wording, and whether the studio needs
 * to appoint anybody or register anything with the Commissioner.

    title: "Who is responsible for your information",
    body: `${STUDIO.name}, the reformer pilates studio inside ${STUDIO.parent} at ${ADDRESS}, decides how the information described here is used. In data protection law that makes the studio the "controller".

Write to ${MAIL} or telephone ${TEL} about anything on this page, including any of the rights set out below.

This notice describes what this website and its booking system actually hold. It is written to match the software rather than to cover every possibility, so where it says something is deleted, something is deleted.`,
  },
  {
    title: "What we hold, and why we are allowed to",
    body: `**To give you an account and take your bookings.** Your name, email address, telephone number, the language you read the site in, and an encrypted form of your password. Your bookings, the classes you attended or missed, the session packs you hold and when they expire. We need these to provide what you have asked for, so the legal basis is the performance of our contract with you.

**To take payment.** The amount, the date, the currency, which method was used, an invoice number, and the reference the payment provider gives us. Card payments are handled entirely by Stripe: card numbers are typed into fields Stripe controls and never reach this website or the studio. Keeping the records is both part of our contract and a legal obligation under tax law.

**To send you the messages the service needs.** Booking confirmations, cancellations, class reminders, a note the night before about the next day, payment receipts, and notices when a class or the timetable changes. These are part of holding an account and cannot be switched off, though you choose which of email, SMS and phone notifications carry them. The legal basis is our contract with you.

**To send you offers and news, only if you asked for it.** A separate, optional choice made at sign-up or in your account, on the basis of your consent. You can withdraw it at any time in My account, and withdrawing it does not affect the service messages above.

**What you tell us about your health.** See the section below. This is special-category information and we rely on your explicit consent.

**Your own optional details.** A profile photograph, date of birth, height and weight, if you choose to add them. You can leave them all blank and use the studio normally. Date of birth is held because reformer work is screened by age, not to send you birthday wishes.

**The studio's own notes about you.** Reception and instructors keep short working notes: which reformer you prefer, which springs, an injury to be careful of. We rely on our legitimate interest in teaching you safely and well. These notes are for the studio only and no page or interface shows them to you; you can still ask to see them, and we will show you.

**Messages you send us.** If you use the contact form we keep your name, email address, telephone number if you gave one, and what you wrote, so somebody can reply.

**Technical information needed to keep the site working.** Which of your devices have allowed notifications, and a short description of the browser each one is, so a device that stops accepting messages can be retired.`,
  },
  {
    title: "What you tell us about your health",
    body: `When you register, and at any time afterwards in your account, you can tell us about anything we should be careful of: an injury, a condition, a pregnancy, a movement that hurts. Reception can also write it down for you if you mention it at the counter.

This is information about your health, which the law treats as needing more protection than the rest. We hold it only because you have explicitly agreed that we should, and you can withdraw that agreement or clear the answer at any time. Leaving it blank is a real answer and does not stop you booking anything.

Who sees it: the people who run the desk, and the instructor teaching a class you are booked into. On the class list at the desk it is deliberately hidden until somebody presses to open it, because that screen sits in a room with other people in it. It is not shown to other members anywhere, and it is never sent outside the studio.

We ask for it because five people on five reformers is a room where the instructor needs to know whose shoulder to watch. Nothing here is medical advice and the studio is not a clinic: if you are unsure whether you should be exercising, ask a doctor rather than us.`,
  },
  {
    title: "Card payments",
    body: `The studio uses Stripe to take card payments. When you pay, the card fields on the checkout page belong to Stripe and are shown inside frames Stripe controls; your card number, expiry date and security code go straight to Stripe and are never sent to this website, never stored by it, and never seen by the studio.

What we keep is the record of the payment: how much, when, in what currency, which method, the invoice number, Stripe's own reference, and a link to the receipt Stripe hosts. That receipt shows the last four digits of the card, which is Stripe's record rather than ours.

Stripe is a payment processor with its own responsibilities as a controller for parts of what it does. Its privacy notice is at stripe.com/privacy.

If you pay in cash or by card at the desk, reception records the amount and the method, and no card details are held in either case.`,
  },
  {
    title: "Who else handles your information",
    body: `The studio uses a small number of companies to run this service. Each one only receives what it needs, and each is bound by a contract that allows it to use the information only for the studio's instructions.

**Render** hosts the website and its database, in a data centre in Frankfurt, Germany.

**Stripe** takes card payments, as described above.

**SMS.to**, a Cyprus company, sends text messages, and only receives a telephone number and the text of the message, and only when a message is actually sent to you by SMS.

**Google** provides the studio's mailbox, so any email we send you passes through it.

Two more things your browser does that are worth naming. The typefaces on this site are requested from Google's font servers, which means Google's servers see the network address your device is using; the site can be changed to serve the typefaces itself if the studio prefers. And notifications are delivered by whichever push service your own browser uses, which is Google's, Apple's or Mozilla's depending on your device, and which the studio has no relationship with or control over.

We do not use any analytics, advertising or tracking service. Nothing on this site reports your behaviour to anybody, and there is no third-party script anywhere on it apart from Stripe's, which loads only on the checkout page.

We do not sell your information and we never will.`,
  },
  {
    title: "Where it is kept, and whether it leaves Europe",
    body: `The database lives in Frankfurt, Germany, inside the European Union.

Stripe and Google both operate outside the European Economic Area as well as inside it, and information reaching them may be transferred to countries whose laws differ from ours. Where that happens they rely on the safeguards European law provides for it, which are either a European Commission decision that the country protects information adequately, or the Commission's standard contractual clauses.`,
  },
  {
    title: "How long we keep it",
    body: `**Your account, until you ask us to erase it.** We do not delete accounts for being quiet. Somebody who trained here two years ago and comes back should find their history where they left it.

**An account that never confirmed its email address: ${UNVERIFIED_DAYS} days.** If you start registering and never enter the code, the whole record is deleted automatically after ${UNVERIFIED_DAYS} days, unless it has a payment or a booking on it. An address the studio has no relationship with is not one it should be holding.

**Confirmation codes: 24 hours after they expire.** Then the record of the code is deleted. We never store the code itself, only a value derived from it that cannot be turned back into the code.

**Payment records: six years from the end of the year they relate to.** Tax and company law in Cyprus requires it, and this is the one category we cannot delete on request while that period is running. It is why erasing a member removes who they were but leaves the fact that a payment of a certain amount happened on a certain date.

**Everything else, until you ask.** Bookings, attendance, session history and the messages we sent you stay on the account until you ask us to erase it, and then they are treated as described in the next section.

We should be straight with you about one thing: apart from the two automatic sweeps named above, nothing here deletes itself on a timer. The studio deletes on request, and does so properly.`,
  },
  {
    title: "What erasing your information actually does",
    body: `You can ask the studio to erase you and it will. Here is exactly what happens, because "we will delete your data" is a sentence that usually hides something.

**Removed completely:** your name, which becomes "Erased member"; your email address, which is replaced with a placeholder at a domain that cannot receive mail; your telephone number; your date of birth, height and weight; everything you told us about your health; your pilates level and experience; the studio's own notes about you; your profile photograph; every device registered for notifications; any half-finished confirmation code; and any message you sent us through the contact form.

Your password is replaced with one nobody holds, so the account cannot be signed into again. Marketing consent, email and SMS notifications are all switched off.

**Kept, and why:** the payments themselves, and the bookings and attendance attached to them. Not because they are convenient to keep, but because the studio's takings for last March are a sum of those rows, and deleting them would rewrite accounts that have already been filed. What is left is a record that a payment of an amount happened on a date, with no name on it. Also kept is the date on which you gave consent to be contacted, which is the evidence the studio may need precisely if you later dispute its dealings with you.

**Not automatically cancelled:** classes you are already booked into. The studio will tell you how many there are so you can decide.

If you have classes booked or a balance you have paid for, tell us what you want done with them first: erasure cannot be undone.`,
  },
  {
    title: "Your rights",
    body: `You can ask the studio to:

**Show you what it holds**, as a copy you can keep.
**Correct anything wrong.** Most of it you can also correct yourself in My account, and reception can correct the rest while you wait.
**Erase you**, as described above.
**Stop using it for a while**, if you dispute something and want it frozen rather than deleted.
**Object** to the studio's use of information where that use rests on its legitimate interests, which is the studio's own working notes.
**Hand it over in a portable form**, for the information you gave us and that we hold under our contract or your consent.
**Withdraw a consent** you gave, at any time. Offers and news are switched off in My account with one press. Health information can be cleared the same way. Withdrawing consent does not undo anything done while it was in force.

Ask by writing to ${MAIL}. The studio will reply within one month, and will tell you if it needs longer and why. There is nothing to pay.

If you are not satisfied with how the studio has answered, you can complain to the Office of the Commissioner for Personal Data Protection in Cyprus, at commissioner@dataprotection.gov.cy or www.dataprotection.gov.cy. You can complain to them without asking us first, though we would rather have the chance to put it right.`,
  },
  {
    title: "Decisions, and how the studio chooses who to write to",
    body: `Nothing on this site makes an automated decision about you that has a legal or similarly significant effect. No algorithm decides whether you may book, what you pay, or whether you are welcome.

When the studio sends an announcement it can narrow the list: members who have never bought a pack, members with nothing left in their balance, members who have not been for a given number of months. That is a filter on who receives a message, applied by a person who then presses send. It changes nothing about your account and has no consequence beyond whether one message arrives.`,
  },
  {
    title: "Age",
    body: `Accounts are for people aged ${AGE} and over. The site asks for a date of birth if you choose to give one and will not accept one that makes you younger than ${AGE}.

The studio does not knowingly hold information about children. If you believe a child has registered, write to ${MAIL} and it will be removed.`,
  },
  {
    title: "How your information is protected",
    body: `Passwords are never stored. What is stored is a value produced from your password by a one-way function designed to be slow to attack, and it cannot be turned back into your password. Nobody at the studio can read it or tell you what your password is.

The whole site is served over an encrypted connection. Confirmation codes are stored the same way as passwords, as a derived value rather than the code.

Inside the studio, access is divided on purpose. Reception can take bookings, sell sessions and see a member's card. It cannot see the studio's takings or membership figures, and it cannot touch another staff account. The desk console asks for a password again even when somebody is already signed in, and locks itself after fifteen minutes of being left alone, because it sits on a counter in a public room.

No system is perfect. If something does go wrong and it is likely to put you at risk, the studio will tell you and the Commissioner, as the law requires.`,
  },
  {
    title: "Cookies",
    body: `This site sets three cookies and stores one preference on your device. None of them is for advertising or tracking, and there is no analytics of any kind.

The cookie notice page sets out each one, what it is for, how long it lasts, and how to change your mind.`,
  },
  {
    title: "Changes to this notice",
    body: `If the studio changes how it uses your information, this page changes with it and the date below changes too. Where a change matters to you, you will hear about it rather than being left to notice it.

/* -------------------------------------------------------------------- terms */

const TERMS_EN: LegalSection[] = [
  {
    title: "Who you are dealing with",
    body: `These terms are the agreement between you and ${STUDIO.name}, the reformer pilates studio inside ${STUDIO.parent} at ${ADDRESS}.

Contact: ${MAIL}, ${TEL}.

By creating an account, booking a class or buying a pack, you agree to what is on this page. Please read it: the parts about cancellation and about your health are the ones people most often wish they had read.`,
  },
  {
    title: "Your account",
    body: `You need an account to book. Give a real name, a real email address and a real telephone number: the studio uses all three to reach you when a class moves.

You confirm your email address with a six-digit code. Until you do, the account cannot book or pay, and if it is never confirmed it is deleted after ${UNVERIFIED_DAYS} days.

One telephone number belongs to one account. Two people cannot share one, because two people sharing a number is two members reception cannot tell apart on the telephone.

Accounts are for people aged ${AGE} and over. Keep your password to yourself; anything done from your account is treated as done by you.`,
  },
  {
    title: "What you are buying",
    body: `You buy sessions, not time. A pack is a number of sessions with a date by which they must be used, and both numbers are shown before you pay and again on your account.

A day pass is one session. A monthly or term pack is a number of sessions a week over that term. An Unlimited plan means as many classes as you like within the term with a limit of one class a day; that daily limit is part of the product and not an oversight.

Sessions belong to the account that bought them. They cannot be given away, sold, shared or transferred to somebody else, and a Duet is the exception that proves the rule: it is one session that admits two people, booked by the member who holds it.

Personal and Duet sessions buy an hour with an instructor and cannot be spent on a group class. Group sessions cannot be spent on an appointment. The two are priced differently and are not interchangeable in either direction.`,
  },
  {
    title: "Booking a class",
    body: `There are ${PLACES} reformers in the room, so a class has ${PLACES} places and a full class is genuinely full. Each class is ${MINUTES} minutes on the mat within an hourly slot; the rest of the hour is the changeover.

One session buys one place in one class. You can book as far ahead as the timetable runs, and you can book the same slot for a run of weeks in one go.

Personal and Duet hours run at midday on weekdays and must be booked by the end of the day before, so that an instructor can be arranged. A Duet is booked by one of the two people, who gives the other person's name.

If you book a class your sessions cannot cover, or your pack expires before the class runs, the site will tell you which and why rather than taking the booking and sorting it out later.`,
  },
  {
    title: "Cancelling, and missing a class",
    body: `**More than ${HOURS} hours before the class: cancel and the session comes back.** One press, no reason needed, and it returns to the pack it came from with that pack's original expiry date.

**Less than ${HOURS} hours before: you can still cancel, and the session is not returned.** The site will say so plainly and ask you to confirm before it does anything. Please do cancel anyway: it frees your place for somebody else, and it tells the instructor not to expect you.

**Not turning up at all** is treated the same way as a late cancellation, except that nobody gets your place.

**Personal and Duet hours** close to cancellation at the end of the day before, for the same reason they close to booking then: an instructor has already been asked to come in and that hour is worked either way.

**Reception can override any of this.** If you ring the studio with a good reason, the person you speak to decides, and they can return the session whatever the clock says. That is deliberate: a rule that cannot be bent by somebody who knows the situation is a rule that punishes the wrong people.`,
  },
  {
    title: "Paying",
    body: `You can pay by card on this site, or by cash or card at the desk. Prices are in euro and include VAT where it applies.

Card payments on the site are taken by Stripe. The studio never sees or holds your card number. A VAT invoice is attached to the confirmation of every card payment made online.

Sessions are added to your balance as soon as the payment is confirmed. If a payment is taken and the sessions do not appear, tell the studio and it will be put right; the payment provider's record is what settles any disagreement about whether money moved.`,
  },
  {
    title: "Refunds and expiry",
    body: `Unused sessions are not refunded in money, and they are not extended because you were away, ill or busy. The expiry date is part of what you bought, and it is shown before you pay and on your account afterwards.

That is the rule, and reception can be asked. Illness, injury, pregnancy and a change in your circumstances are exactly the cases the studio would rather hear about than enforce a date against. Ask.

If the studio cancels a class you had booked, the session goes back to your balance and you have not lost anything. If the studio closes for a period long enough to threaten your expiry date, it will move the date rather than let it run out.

Buying online is a distance contract, and consumer law gives you fourteen days to change your mind about one. That right does not extend to sessions you have already used, and a class you have attended has been provided. If you have bought a pack and used none of it, write within fourteen days and the studio will refund it.`,
  },
  {
    title: "Your health, and being honest with us",
    body: `Reformer pilates is exercise on a machine with springs. By booking you confirm that you are well enough to take part and that nothing you know of makes it unsafe for you.

Tell the studio anything it should be careful of: an injury, a condition, a recent operation, a pregnancy, a movement that hurts. There is a box for it when you register and in your account, and reception will write it down if you would rather say it out loud. It stays between you, the desk and the instructor teaching your class.

If something changes, tell us. An instructor who does not know about your shoulder cannot work around it.

The studio's instructors are qualified to teach pilates and are not doctors. Nothing they or this site tell you is medical advice. If you are unsure whether you should be exercising, ask a doctor first, and please do that rather than asking us to decide.

An instructor may change an exercise for you, ask you not to do one, or ask you to sit a class out, if in their judgement it is not safe. That judgement is theirs and it is final in the room.`,
  },
  {
    title: "In the studio",
    body: `Arrive a few minutes early. A ${MINUTES}-minute class starting on the hour cannot wait, and an instructor cannot safely set somebody up on a reformer while the class is already moving; if you arrive after a class has begun you may be asked to sit it out, and that counts as a class taken.

Grip socks are required, for hygiene and because bare feet slip on a moving carriage.

Please treat the equipment, the instructors and the other four people in the room with care. The studio can ask somebody to leave, and in a serious case can close their account, if their behaviour makes the room unsafe or unpleasant for anybody else. Sessions are not refunded in that case.`,
  },
  {
    title: "Changes the studio makes",
    body: `The timetable, the instructors and the prices can change. Where a change affects a class you have already booked you will be told, and where a class is cancelled the session comes back.

The instructor named on a class is the studio's intention rather than a promise: rotas change, people are ill, and the class still runs. You are told when the name changes on a class you hold.

Prices change only forwards. A pack you have already bought keeps the price you paid and the terms you bought it on.

The studio closes on public holidays and can close for maintenance or for reasons outside its control. Closures are announced, bookings inside them are cancelled and the sessions returned.`,
  },
  {
    title: "If something goes wrong",
    body: `The studio is responsible for providing the classes you have paid for with reasonable skill and care, and for keeping its equipment properly maintained.

It is not responsible for injury that comes from ignoring an instructor's instruction, from using equipment in a way you were told not to, or from a condition you chose not to tell us about. It is not responsible for belongings left in the studio.

Nothing in these terms limits anything that cannot lawfully be limited, including liability for death or personal injury caused by negligence, or for fraud. Your rights as a consumer under Cypriot and European law stand whatever this page says, and where anything here conflicts with them, they win.`,
  },
  {
    title: "Complaints, and the law that applies",
    body: `If something is wrong, tell the studio first: ${MAIL}, or ${TEL}, or the person at the desk. Most of it can be settled in a conversation.

These terms are governed by the law of the Republic of Cyprus, and the Cypriot courts have jurisdiction. As a consumer you keep the right to bring proceedings where you live.

The studio can change these terms. If a change matters to you, you will be told rather than left to find it. Continuing to use your account after a change means accepting the version that is here.

**apex_desk.** For the studio's own staff only. The desk console asks for a password again even when somebody is already signed in, and this remembers that it was given. It lasts fifteen minutes of inactivity and then the console locks itself, because it sits on a counter in a room the public walks through.

Neither of these is set before you sign in, and neither can be refused while you are signed in: they are not a way of learning anything about you, they are the mechanism by which the site knows who is asking.`,

It contains a date and nothing else, it never leaves your device, and the studio cannot read it.

Refuse these and the site still works: it will simply open in its default language each time, and may ask again about notifications.`,

  {
    title: "Stripe, on the checkout page only",

They load only on the checkout page, only when you are signed in and actually paying, and they are necessary to take a payment safely. Stripe explains them at stripe.com/legal/cookies-policy.

The studio cannot switch these off and still take card payments. If you would rather not have them, pay at the desk.`,
  },
  {
    title: "Other requests your browser makes",
    body: `Two things are worth naming even though they set no cookie, because being asked about cookies and told nothing about these would be a strange kind of honesty.

**Typefaces.** The fonts on this site are requested from Google's font servers, which means those servers see the network address your device is using and what kind of browser it is. No cookie is set and nothing is stored on your device. The studio can serve the fonts itself instead, which would remove the request entirely, and it is a single change if you would prefer that: say so.

**Notifications.** If you turn on class reminders, they are delivered through whichever push service your own browser uses, which is Google's, Apple's or Mozilla's depending on your device. That relationship is between your browser and its maker; the studio holds only the address that service gives it for your device, and deletes it when you turn notifications off.

Refusing the optional cookies above does not stop either of these, and it would be misleading to imply otherwise. The first is a request for a file; the second only happens if you ask for it.`,

**Για την πληρωμή.** Το ποσό, την ημερομηνία, το νόμισμα, τον τρόπο πληρωμής, τον αριθμό τιμολογίου και την αναφορά που μας δίνει ο πάροχος πληρωμών. Οι πληρωμές με κάρτα γίνονται εξ ολοκλήρου μέσω της Stripe: οι αριθμοί καρτών πληκτρολογούνται σε πεδία που ελέγχει η Stripe και δεν φτάνουν ποτέ σε αυτή την ιστοσελίδα ούτε στο στούντιο. Η διατήρηση των εγγραφών είναι μέρος της σύμβασης και ταυτόχρονα νομική υποχρέωση από τη φορολογική νομοθεσία.

**Για τα μηνύματα που χρειάζεται η υπηρεσία.** Επιβεβαιώσεις κρατήσεων, ακυρώσεις, υπενθυμίσεις μαθημάτων, μια σημείωση το βράδυ για την επόμενη μέρα, αποδείξεις πληρωμής και ειδοποιήσεις όταν αλλάζει ένα μάθημα ή το πρόγραμμα. Αυτά είναι μέρος του να έχεις λογαριασμό και δεν απενεργοποιούνται, αλλά επιλέγεις ποια από email, SMS και ειδοποιήσεις κινητού τα μεταφέρουν. Η νομική βάση είναι η σύμβασή μας.

**Για προσφορές και νέα, μόνο αν το ζήτησες.** Ξεχωριστή, προαιρετική επιλογή στην εγγραφή ή στον λογαριασμό σου, με βάση τη συγκατάθεσή σου. Μπορείς να την ανακαλέσεις οποτεδήποτε από τον λογαριασμό σου, και αυτό δεν επηρεάζει τα μηνύματα υπηρεσίας παραπάνω.

**Ό,τι μας λες για την υγεία σου.** Δες την ενότητα παρακάτω. Είναι δεδομένα ειδικής κατηγορίας και βασιζόμαστε στη ρητή συγκατάθεσή σου.

**Τα δικά σου προαιρετικά στοιχεία.** Φωτογραφία προφίλ, ημερομηνία γέννησης, ύψος και βάρος, αν θέλεις να τα προσθέσεις. Μπορείς να τα αφήσεις όλα κενά και να χρησιμοποιείς κανονικά το στούντιο. Η ημερομηνία γέννησης κρατείται γιατί η άσκηση στο reformer αξιολογείται και με βάση την ηλικία, όχι για ευχές γενεθλίων.

**Οι δικές μας σημειώσεις για σένα.** Η υποδοχή και οι εκπαιδευτές κρατούν σύντομες σημειώσεις εργασίας: ποιο reformer προτιμάς, ποια ελατήρια, ένας τραυματισμός που θέλει προσοχή. Βασιζόμαστε στο έννομο συμφέρον μας να σε διδάσκουμε με ασφάλεια. Οι σημειώσεις είναι μόνο για το στούντιο και καμία σελίδα δεν σου τις δείχνει· μπορείς πάντως να ζητήσεις να τις δεις και θα σου τις δείξουμε.

**Μηνύματα που μας στέλνεις.** Αν χρησιμοποιήσεις τη φόρμα επικοινωνίας κρατάμε το όνομά σου, το email, το τηλέφωνο αν το έδωσες και ό,τι έγραψες, ώστε κάποιος να απαντήσει.

**Τεχνικές πληροφορίες για να δουλεύει η σελίδα.** Ποιες συσκευές σου έχουν επιτρέψει ειδοποιήσεις και μια σύντομη περιγραφή του browser της κάθε μιας, ώστε μια συσκευή που σταματά να δέχεται μηνύματα να αποσύρεται.`,

Είναι πληροφορία για την υγεία σου, την οποία ο νόμος θεωρεί ότι χρειάζεται περισσότερη προστασία. Την κρατάμε μόνο επειδή έχεις συμφωνήσει ρητά, και μπορείς να ανακαλέσεις τη συμφωνία ή να καθαρίσεις την απάντηση οποτεδήποτε.

Ό,τι κρατάμε είναι η εγγραφή της πληρωμής: πόσο, πότε, σε ποιο νόμισμα, με ποιον τρόπο, ο αριθμός τιμολογίου, η αναφορά της Stripe και ένας σύνδεσμος στην απόδειξη που φιλοξενεί η Stripe. Εκείνη η απόδειξη δείχνει τα τέσσερα τελευταία ψηφία της κάρτας, που είναι εγγραφή της Stripe και όχι δική μας.

Η Stripe είναι πάροχος πληρωμών με τις δικές της ευθύνες. Η πολιτική απορρήτου της είναι στο stripe.com/privacy.

**Render**: φιλοξενεί την ιστοσελίδα και τη βάση δεδομένων, σε κέντρο δεδομένων στη Φρανκφούρτη της Γερμανίας.

**SMS.to**, κυπριακή εταιρεία, στέλνει τα γραπτά μηνύματα, και λαμβάνει μόνο έναν αριθμό τηλεφώνου και το κείμενο του μηνύματος, και μόνο όταν σου σταλεί όντως SMS.

**Google**: παρέχει το ηλεκτρονικό ταχυδρομείο του στούντιο, οπότε κάθε email που σου στέλνουμε περνά από εκεί.

Δύο ακόμη πράγματα που κάνει ο browser σου αξίζουν αναφορά. Οι γραμματοσειρές ζητούνται από τους διακομιστές γραμματοσειρών της Google, που σημαίνει ότι εκείνοι βλέπουν τη διεύθυνση δικτύου της συσκευής σου· η σελίδα μπορεί να αλλάξει ώστε να σερβίρει μόνη της τις γραμματοσειρές.

Δεν χρησιμοποιούμε καμία υπηρεσία στατιστικών, διαφήμισης ή παρακολούθησης. Τίποτα σε αυτή τη σελίδα δεν αναφέρει σε κανέναν τη συμπεριφορά σου, και δεν υπάρχει σενάριο τρίτου πουθενά εκτός από της Stripe, που φορτώνει μόνο στη σελίδα πληρωμής.

**Αφαιρούνται εντελώς:** το όνομά σου, που γίνεται "Διαγραμμένο μέλος"· το email σου, που αντικαθίσταται με πλαστό σε τομέα που δεν μπορεί να λάβει αλληλογραφία· το τηλέφωνο· η ημερομηνία γέννησης, το ύψος και το βάρος· όλα όσα μας είπες για την υγεία σου· το επίπεδο και η εμπειρία σου· οι δικές μας σημειώσεις για σένα· η φωτογραφία προφίλ· κάθε συσκευή που είχε εγγραφεί για ειδοποιήσεις· κάθε μισοτελειωμένος κωδικός επιβεβαίωσης· και κάθε μήνυμα που μας έστειλες μέσω της φόρμας επικοινωνίας.

**Δεν ακυρώνονται αυτόματα:** τα μαθήματα στα οποία είσαι ήδη κρατημένος. Το στούντιο θα σου πει πόσα είναι για να αποφασίσεις.

Μία συνεδρία αγοράζει μία θέση σε ένα μάθημα. Μπορείς να κλείσεις όσο μακριά φτάνει το πρόγραμμα, και μπορείς να κλείσεις την ίδια ώρα για σειρά εβδομάδων με μία κίνηση.

Ένας εκπαιδευτής μπορεί να αλλάξει μια άσκηση για σένα, να σου ζητήσει να μην την κάνεις, ή να σου ζητήσει να καθίσεις έξω από ένα μάθημα, αν κατά την κρίση του δεν είναι ασφαλές. Η κρίση αυτή είναι δική του και είναι τελική μέσα στην αίθουσα.`,

    body: `Έλα λίγα λεπτά πιο νωρίς. Ένα μάθημα ${MINUTES} λεπτών που ξεκινά στην ώρα δεν μπορεί να περιμένει, και ένας εκπαιδευτής δεν μπορεί με ασφάλεια να ρυθμίσει κάποιον σε reformer ενώ το μάθημα κινείται· αν έρθεις αφού ξεκινήσει, μπορεί να σου ζητηθεί να καθίσεις έξω, και αυτό μετράει ως μάθημα.

Τα αντιολισθητικά κάλτσες είναι υποχρεωτικά, για υγιεινή και γιατί τα γυμνά πόδια γλιστρούν σε κινούμενο φορείο.

Φρόντισε τον εξοπλισμό, τους εκπαιδευτές και τους άλλους τέσσερις ανθρώπους στην αίθουσα. Το στούντιο μπορεί να ζητήσει από κάποιον να αποχωρήσει, και σε σοβαρή περίπτωση να κλείσει τον λογαριασμό του, αν η συμπεριφορά του κάνει την αίθουσα μη ασφαλή ή δυσάρεστη για άλλους. Σε αυτή την περίπτωση οι συνεδρίες δεν επιστρέφονται.`,

    body: `Το πρόγραμμα, οι εκπαιδευτές και οι τιμές μπορούν να αλλάξουν. Όπου μια αλλαγή επηρεάζει μάθημα που έχεις κλείσει θα ενημερωθείς, και όπου ένα μάθημα ακυρώνεται η συνεδρία επιστρέφει.

Ο εκπαιδευτής που αναφέρεται σε ένα μάθημα είναι η πρόθεση του στούντιο και όχι υπόσχεση: τα προγράμματα αλλάζουν, οι άνθρωποι αρρωσταίνουν, και το μάθημα γίνεται. Ενημερώνεσαι όταν αλλάζει το όνομα σε μάθημα που έχεις.

Οι τιμές αλλάζουν μόνο προς το μέλλον. Ένα πακέτο που αγόρασες κρατά την τιμή και τους όρους με τους οποίους το αγόρασες.

Το στούντιο κλείνει τις επίσημες αργίες και μπορεί να κλείσει για συντήρηση ή για λόγους πέρα από τον έλεγχό του. Τα κλεισίματα ανακοινώνονται, οι κρατήσεις μέσα σε αυτά ακυρώνονται και οι συνεδρίες επιστρέφονται.`,

    body: `Το στούντιο είναι υπεύθυνο να παρέχει τα μαθήματα που πλήρωσες με εύλογη δεξιότητα και επιμέλεια, και να συντηρεί σωστά τον εξοπλισμό του.

Δεν είναι υπεύθυνο για τραυματισμό που προκύπτει από την αγνόηση οδηγίας εκπαιδευτή, από τη χρήση εξοπλισμού με τρόπο που σου είπαν να μην κάνεις, ή από κατάσταση που επέλεξες να μη μας πεις. Δεν είναι υπεύθυνο για αντικείμενα που αφήνονται στο στούντιο.

Τίποτα σε αυτούς τους όρους δεν περιορίζει ό,τι δεν μπορεί νόμιμα να περιοριστεί, συμπεριλαμβανομένης της ευθύνης για θάνατο ή σωματική βλάβη από αμέλεια, ή για απάτη. Τα δικαιώματά σου ως καταναλωτή κατά το κυπριακό και το ευρωπαϊκό δίκαιο ισχύουν ό,τι κι αν λέει αυτή η σελίδα, και όπου κάτι εδώ συγκρούεται με αυτά, υπερισχύουν εκείνα.`,

Το στούντιο μπορεί να αλλάξει αυτούς τους όρους. Αν μια αλλαγή σε αφορά, θα ενημερωθείς. Η συνέχιση της χρήσης του λογαριασμού σου μετά από αλλαγή σημαίνει αποδοχή της έκδοσης που βρίσκεται εδώ.

Αυτό που αποθηκεύει είναι τρία cookies και μία προτίμηση, που αναφέρονται παρακάτω. Δύο από τα cookies είναι ο τρόπος με τον οποίο η σελίδα ξέρει ότι είσαι συνδεδεμένος· χωρίς αυτά δεν μπορεί να λειτουργήσει καθόλου. Το τρίτο θυμάται τη γλώσσα που επέλεξες.

Δεν μπορεί να το διαβάσει κανένα σενάριο, ούτε το δικό μας, και διαρκεί τριάντα ημέρες ή μέχρι να αποσυνδεθείς.

**apex_desk.** Μόνο για το προσωπικό του στούντιο. Η κονσόλα ζητά κωδικό ξανά ακόμη κι αν κάποιος είναι συνδεδεμένος, και αυτό θυμάται ότι δόθηκε. Διαρκεί δεκαπέντε λεπτά αδράνειας και μετά η κονσόλα κλειδώνει, γιατί βρίσκεται σε πάγκο σε χώρο από τον οποίο περνά κοινό.

Κανένα από τα δύο δεν τίθεται πριν συνδεθείς, και κανένα δεν μπορεί να απορριφθεί όσο είσαι συνδεδεμένος: δεν είναι τρόπος να μάθουμε κάτι για σένα, είναι ο μηχανισμός με τον οποίο η σελίδα ξέρει ποιος ρωτά.`,

**Η υπενθύμιση ειδοποιήσεων.** Αν απορρίψεις το μήνυμα που ρωτά αν θέλεις υπενθυμίσεις μαθημάτων στο κινητό σου, η απόφαση θυμάται στην αποθήκευση του browser σου ώστε να μη ρωτηθείς ξανά σε εκείνη τη συσκευή. Περιέχει μια ημερομηνία και τίποτα άλλο, δεν φεύγει ποτέ από τη συσκευή σου, και το στούντιο δεν μπορεί να τη διαβάσει.

Φορτώνουν μόνο στη σελίδα πληρωμής, μόνο όταν είσαι συνδεδεμένος και όντως πληρώνεις, και είναι απαραίτητα για να γίνει η πληρωμή με ασφάλεια. Η Stripe τα εξηγεί στο stripe.com/legal/cookies-policy.

**Γραμματοσειρές.** Οι γραμματοσειρές της σελίδας ζητούνται από τους διακομιστές της Google, που σημαίνει ότι εκείνοι βλέπουν τη διεύθυνση δικτύου της συσκευής σου και τι είδους browser είναι. Δεν τίθεται cookie και δεν αποθηκεύεται τίποτα στη συσκευή σου. Το στούντιο μπορεί να σερβίρει μόνο του τις γραμματοσειρές, που θα αφαιρούσε εντελώς το αίτημα.

**Ειδοποιήσεις.** Αν ενεργοποιήσεις τις υπενθυμίσεις μαθημάτων, παραδίδονται μέσω της υπηρεσίας push του δικού σου browser, δηλαδή της Google, της Apple ή της Mozilla ανάλογα με τη συσκευή. Η σχέση αυτή είναι μεταξύ του browser σου και του κατασκευαστή του· το στούντιο κρατά μόνο τη διεύθυνση που του δίνει εκείνη η υπηρεσία για τη συσκευή σου, και τη διαγράφει όταν απενεργοποιήσεις τις ειδοποιήσεις.

Η απόρριψη των προαιρετικών cookies παραπάνω δεν σταματά κανένα από τα δύο, και θα ήταν παραπλανητικό να υπονοηθεί το αντίθετο.`,
