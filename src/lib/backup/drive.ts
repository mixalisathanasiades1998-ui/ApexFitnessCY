/**
 * Putting a file into the studio's own Google Drive, over plain HTTPS.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * **Why no Google library.**
 *
 * The whole conversation with Drive is three REST calls — swap a refresh token
 * for a short-lived access token, find or make a folder, upload a file — and
 * every one of them is a `fetch`. Pulling in `googleapis` (tens of megabytes,
 * its own release cycle, a native-ish dependency tree) to save writing those
 * three calls is a bad trade on a small server. So this file has no
 * dependencies at all beyond `fetch`, which Node has built in.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * **Whose Drive, and how little access it has.**
 *
 * The credentials belong to an OAuth client the studio created once, and the
 * refresh token was granted by the company's own Google account signing in and
 * pressing Allow (see scripts/drive-auth.mjs). So the upload happens *as that
 * company*, into *their* Drive, and every file is owned by them and counts
 * against their storage — which is exactly what "the data lives in their own
 * Google account" means.
 *
 * The scope is `drive.file`, the narrowest one that can write: it grants access
 * only to files this app itself created. It cannot read, list, or touch anything
 * else in the company's Drive. So even though the app can drop a backup in, it
 * could never rifle through their documents, and the consent screen says so.
 *
 * A service account was the obvious alternative and does not work here: a service
 * account has no Drive storage of its own, so a file it uploads into a normal
 * Gmail account is refused with `storageQuotaExceeded`. Acting as the real user
 * is the path that works on an ordinary business Gmail.
