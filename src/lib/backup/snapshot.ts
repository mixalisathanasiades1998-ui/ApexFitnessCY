/**
 * A consistent copy of the database, ready to send somewhere safe.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * **Why not just copy the file.**
 *
 * The database is a single SQLite file, and the obvious backup is `cp apex.db
 * apex-backup.db`. It is also wrong, quietly. SQLite in WAL mode (which this app
 * uses) is writing to the file and a side `-wal` file at the same time the copy
 * is being read, so a plain copy taken mid-write is a *torn* file: it looks like
 * a database, opens like a database, and is missing the last few transactions or
 * is corrupt in a way nobody notices until the day it is the only copy left.
 *
 * SQLite ships the correct tool for exactly this, and better-sqlite3 exposes it:
 * `.backup()` performs an online backup that is transactionally consistent even
 * while the app keeps taking bookings. The output is a clean, standalone `.db`
 * that opens in anything — Navicat, another copy of this app, the `sqlite3` CLI.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * **Encryption is optional, and it is the honest default to offer.**
 *
 * The file contains members' names, emails, phones and their health notes.
 * Passwords inside it are already hashed and safe, but the personal data is
 * readable by anyone who opens the file. So if `BACKUP_ENCRYPT_PASSWORD` is set,
 * the snapshot is sealed with AES-256-GCM before it leaves the building, and
 * only that password opens it again (see scripts/backup-decrypt.mjs).
 *
 * Left unset, the snapshot is a plain `.db` that opens with a double-click. That
 * is the friendlier choice for analysis and the weaker one for privacy, and the
 * studio makes the call by whether it sets the password. The docs recommend
 * setting it; the code does not force it, because a backup nobody can open in a
 * hurry is its own kind of failure.
