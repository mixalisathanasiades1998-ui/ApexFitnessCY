   * old JavaScript, which asks for a chunk by the filename the old build used,
   * and that filename no longer exists. The request 404s and the page half
   * works: a button does nothing, or a panel never loads, with nothing in the
   * console a non-developer could act on.
   *
   * With this set, Next adds `?dpl=<id>` to the assets it requests, so a browser
   * carrying the old build asks for the old deploy's copies and a fresh visitor
   * gets the new ones. It also means every deploy changes every asset URL, which
   * is the cache-busting half of the same coin.
   *
   * `RENDER_GIT_COMMIT` is set by the platform to the commit being built, which
   * makes it exactly the right value: it changes when and only when the code
   * does. Undefined off Render, where Next falls back to its own build id and
