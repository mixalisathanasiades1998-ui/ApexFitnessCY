/**
 * A SQL prompt on the mirror, for asking the database questions.
 *
 *     npm run db:sql                          an interactive prompt
 *     npm run db:sql -- "select ..."          one query and out
 *
 * At the prompt:
 *
 *     \dt              list the tables, with row counts
 *     \d users         one table's columns and types
 *     \q               leave
 *
 * ---
 *
 * **Why this and not `db:peek`.**
 *
 * `db:peek` reads the studio's real SQLite file, so it is deliberately locked
 * down: read-only at the driver, and it refuses anything that is not a select.
 * That is right for a tool pointed at live bookings, and it makes it a poor
 * place to *explore*. Every experiment has to be phrased perfectly the first
 * time, dates come out as integers like `1801674000`, and there is no room to be
 * wrong.
 *
 * This one points at the Postgres mirror instead, which changes what is safe.
 * The mirror is a disposable copy rebuilt by `npm run db:mirror`, so nothing
 * typed here can reach the studio's data: no query, no `update`, not a `drop
 * table`. The worst outcome is a mangled copy and a rerun of the mirror. So
 * this tool allows anything, on purpose, because a sandbox that punishes
 * mistakes is not a sandbox.
 *
 * It also gets Postgres' own SQL, which is the point of having gone to the
 * trouble: real dates, `date_trunc`, `interval '7 days'`, window functions,
 * `filter (where ...)`.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * **On being handed a live connection anyway.**
 *
 * The one thing this cannot check is whether `MIRROR_DATABASE_URL` really points
 * at a mirror. If somebody one day points it at a database that matters, this
 * script will cheerfully run a `delete` against it. The guard is the naming and
 * the banner rather than the code, and it is worth knowing about rather than
 * assuming away.

/**
 * The studio's timezone, and why this matters more than it looks.
 *
 * Postgres defaults a connection to UTC, and Cyprus is two or three hours ahead
 * of it depending on the season. Left alone, two things go quietly wrong: a
 * class at 16:00 in Larnaca prints as `13:00`, and — worse, because it is
 * invisible — `starts_at::date` and `date_trunc('day', ...)` cut the day at
 * midnight UTC, so a 01:00 Saturday class is filed under Friday. A query asking
 * "how many classes on the 1st of October" then quietly answers about a day that
 * is not the 1st of October.
 *
 * So the session is put into studio time on connect and dates are printed in it.
 * Read from src/lib/studio.ts rather than written twice, because the studio
 * moving is exactly the kind of change that gets made in one place.
