/**
 * Open an encrypted backup, turning apex-….db.enc back into a plain apex-….db.
 *
 *     npm run backup:decrypt -- apex-2026-09-07-1430.db.enc
 *
 * Only needed if BACKUP_ENCRYPT_PASSWORD was set when the backup was taken. The
 * password is asked for on the terminal (never typed on the command line, where
 * a shell would remember it), and the plain .db it writes out opens directly in
 * Navicat or any SQLite tool.
 *
 * The format is the one scripts/../src/lib/backup/snapshot.ts writes:
 * MAGIC | salt(16) | iv(12) | authTag(16) | ciphertext, AES-256-GCM with a
 * scrypt-derived key. GCM authenticates, so a wrong password or a damaged file
 * fails loudly rather than producing quiet garbage.
