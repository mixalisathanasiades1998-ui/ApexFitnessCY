/**
 * The production start command. This IS `npm start`, on purpose: a hosting
 * provider's default start command is `npm start`, and a deploy that only works
 * when somebody remembers to change a field in a dashboard is a deploy that
 * breaks. `npm run start:next` is the raw `next start` underneath, and
 * `npm run start:render` is a spelled-out alias of this script.
 *
 * Why this exists instead of plain `next start`.
 *
 * The database is a file on a persistent disk, and a host mounts that disk at
 * runtime only — not during the build, and not during a pre-deploy step, which
 * run on separate compute. So nothing that touches the database can live in the
 * build, however convenient that would be.
 *
 * That matters because the first boot on a new disk finds no file at all, and
 * `ensureSchema()` deliberately does nothing to a database with no `users`
 * table: it is a migrator, not a creator, and refusing to guess at a database
 * that does not exist yet is the right behaviour for it. Without this script the
 * first deploy goes green and every page on the website is a 500 reading
 * "no such table: users", which is a confusing way to find out.
 *
 * So: build the schema and seed the catalogue once, on the first boot only, then
 * hand over to `next start`. Every boot after that finds the table and drops
 * straight through, which is why this is safe as the permanent start command
 * rather than something to run by hand and remember.

 * Cap the JavaScript heap, because the container is smaller than Node thinks.

 * reads the *host* machine's memory and sizes its old-space heap for gigabytes.
 * So under load V8 lets the heap grow toward a ceiling that does not exist here,
 * sails past 512 MB, and the platform kills the instance and restarts it. That
 * is the memory-limit email, and it is not a leak: it is Node being generous
 * with memory it has not got.
 *
 * Telling it the real ceiling makes it collect garbage sooner and keep the heap
 * small. 384 MB leaves room for the parts that live outside the JS heap — the
 * image optimiser's native buffers and the SQLite library — inside the 512.
 * Only for the running site: the build runs on separate, larger compute and is
 * left alone, so this is set on the child rather than for the whole service.
 *
 * MEMORY_MB overrides it from the environment, so moving to a bigger instance is
 * one dashboard value and not a code change: set it to the new size and the cap
 * follows.
 *
 * Any heap size already in NODE_OPTIONS is *replaced*, not kept. A large value
 * inherited from the build step — where a bigger heap is wanted and the compute
 * is bigger too — is exactly what must not reach the running site, so the
