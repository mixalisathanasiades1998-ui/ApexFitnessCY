/**
 * The one pair of keys web push needs, written straight into .env.
 *
 *   npm run push:keys                 generate and write them
 *   npm run push:keys -- --print      print them instead, to paste by hand
 *   npm run push:keys -- --force      replace an existing pair (see the warning)
 *
 * There is no company to sign up with for push. The message goes straight from
 * this server to Google's, Apple's or Mozilla's push service, signed with a key
 * pair that belongs to the studio and nobody else. This makes it.
 *
 * It writes the file itself rather than printing instructions, because printing
 * instructions is exactly what went wrong the first time: the keys scrolled past
 * in a terminal, nothing was pasted, and the studio spent an evening wondering
 * why no notification arrived. A setup step that depends on somebody copying
 * three lines correctly is a setup step that fails.
 *
 * Generate the pair once and keep it. Changing it later silently invalidates
 * every device that has already subscribed — they do not error, they simply stop
 * arriving — so this refuses to overwrite an existing pair unless asked twice.
