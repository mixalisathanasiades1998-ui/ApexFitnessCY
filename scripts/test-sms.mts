/**
 * What a text message costs, and whether it actually leaves.
 *
 *   npm run test:sms
 *
 * Two halves, and the first one is the one that matters.
 *
 * **The arithmetic.** An SMS is billed per segment, and how many segments a
 * piece of text becomes depends on which alphabet it forces: 160 characters of
 * Latin, or 70 the moment one Greek letter appears. Every number the desk sees
 * before pressing send comes from `smsCost`, so if that function is wrong the
 * studio is quoted a price it will not be charged. There is no way to notice
 * that except by testing it, because the disagreement only shows up on an
 * invoice a month later.
 *
 * **The transport.** A local server stands in for api.sms.to, so the test can
 * assert what we actually put on the wire — the endpoint, the bearer token, the
 * sender ID, the message — without an account, a key, or a cent. The thing being
 * guarded against is a silent success: a transport that returns `ok` while
 * sending the wrong field name would look identical from the outside.
 *
 * Nothing here needs the app running or the database.
