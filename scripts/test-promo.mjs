/**
 * The opening offer, over HTTP, with the offer switched on.
 *
 *   npm run build
 *   PROMO_ENABLED=true npx next start -p 3100
 *   npm run test:promo -- http://localhost:3100
 *
 * Its own suite because it needs the opposite environment from every other one:
 * the rest of the suites assert what a new account starts with and therefore run
 * with `PROMO_ENABLED=false`. Trying to serve both from one file would mean
 * assertions that change with the calendar, which is the kind of test that gets
 * deleted in six months rather than fixed.
 *
 * What it is really checking is two things: that the free session arrives only
 * once the emailed code has been typed back, and that a session tied to the
 * offer's dates cannot be spent outside them. Everything else is scaffolding.
 *
 * Note that this suite verifies through the real route rather than through the
 * `markVerified` fixture every other suite uses. It has to: the grant now lives
 * in that route, so a fixture that writes the column would run none of the code
 * this file exists to test. See `plantCode` in fixture-verify.mjs.
