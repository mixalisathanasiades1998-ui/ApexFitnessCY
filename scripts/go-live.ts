/**
 * Clear the testing out of the database, once, on the day the studio opens.
 *
 *     npm run go-live
 *
 * ---
 *
 * **What this is for.**
 *
 * By the time a website opens, its database is full of the work of getting it
 * open: accounts called "Prof Test", twenty-five Stripe attempts of which eight
 * went through, bookings made to see whether booking worked. None of that is the
 * studio's data, and on the first real morning it is in the way of the studio's
 * data. It is also, in one specific respect, a liability: the seeded desk
 * passwords are written in `src/db/seed.ts` in a repository that has been
 * public, so any account still using one has to be treated as compromised.
 *
 * So this deletes the people and the history, keeps the studio's own setup, and
 * rebuilds the timetable. It is meant to be run once.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * **What it keeps, and why the line is drawn there.**
 *
 * Deleted: every account, every booking, every purchase, every session balance
 * and ledger line, every notice, every push subscription, every verification
 * code, and the generated timetable.
 *
 * Kept: the class types, the weekly rota of templates, the packages and their
 * prices, the instructors, any pricing rules, and any closure days already
 * entered. That is the studio describing itself, and re-entering seventy-five
 * rota rows by hand on opening morning would be an unforced error.
 *
 * A useful side effect: invoice numbering restarts at 0001. `assignInvoiceNumber`
 * derives the sequence from the highest `invoice_seq` in `purchases`, so
 * emptying that table is all it takes to hand the accountant a clean, gapless
 * first year. Nothing extra to reset, and nothing to remember.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * **Everything that can refuse, refuses before anything is deleted.**
 *
 * The order here is the whole design. Every check that could fail — the database
 * is the wrong one, the desk passwords are missing, they are still the burned
 * defaults, the two desk addresses are the same — happens *first*, and the
 * password hashing happens first too. A script that deletes every account and
 * then discovers it cannot create the owner has locked the studio out of its own
 * website on opening day, from a shell prompt, with no way back except a disk
 * snapshot.
 *
 * The deletion and the rebuild are then one SQLite transaction. Either the
 * studio starts clean with a working desk account and a full timetable, or
 * nothing happened at all.
