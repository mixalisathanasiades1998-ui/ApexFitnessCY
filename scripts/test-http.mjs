 * The language of a push notification, which used to be English for everybody.
 *
 * The site has always known which language a member reads it in — the switch at
 * the top of every page sets a cookie, and every page is rendered from it. What
 * the server did not know was which language to use when nobody is looking at a
 * page, and that is the only time a notification is ever sent: a reminder two
 * hours before a class is composed by a sweep with no browser attached to it.
 * So a member reading the site in Greek got a Greek notice in their account and
 * an English copy of the same message on their phone.
 *
 * The fix is a column, written when the switch is pressed. This asserts the
 * plumbing end to end: the route accepts a choice, refuses nonsense, and the
 * account remembers it.
