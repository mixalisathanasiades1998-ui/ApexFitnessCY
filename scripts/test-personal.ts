/**
 * Personal and duet sessions, and the Unlimited plan, checked against a real
 * database.  Run with:  npm run test:personal
 *
 * What this suite is for. Two new rules were added to a credit system that had
 * exactly one rule before, and both of them are the kind that fail silently:
 *
 *   1. a session of the wrong kind must not pay for a class, in either
 *      direction. Get this wrong and a member spends €30 of one to one on an
 *      18:00 group class, or is told they have no sessions while holding six
 *   2. an appointment closes at the end of the previous day, and so does its
 *      cancellation. Get this wrong and an instructor is called in for an hour
 *      that has been cancelled, or is not called in for one that has not
 *
 * Neither would throw. Both would be discovered by a member losing money, which
 * is why they are asserted here rather than tested by hand once.
 *
 * Also checked: the Unlimited arithmetic, the one-a-day rule, the appointment
 * slots being where the studio says they are, the studio's own email carrying
 * what somebody needs to make a phone call, and no em dash in any of the new
 * words in either language.
 *
 * Every fixture is a throwaway account with `isTest` set, removed at the end, so
 * this is safe to run against dev.db as often as you like.
