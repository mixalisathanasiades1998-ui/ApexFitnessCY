/**
 * The one-time handshake that lets the studio's server write to a Google Drive.
 *
 *     npm run drive:auth
 *
 * Run it once per company, on your own computer, after you have created the
 * OAuth client in Google (see docs/backup.md). It:
 *
 *   1. opens a Google sign-in page in your browser,
 *   2. you sign in as the company whose Drive the backups should go to, and
 *      press Allow,
 *   3. catches Google's reply on a local port, swaps it for a refresh token,
 *   4. prints that refresh token.
 *
 * You then paste the printed token into Render as GDRIVE_REFRESH_TOKEN. That is
 * the durable credential; nothing else from this run is kept, and the token is
 * never shown to anyone but you, in your own terminal.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * **Why a local web server and not a code to copy.**
 *
 * Google retired the old "copy this code out of the browser" flow. The supported
 * way for a tool like this is a loopback redirect: Google sends the reply to
 * http://localhost on your own machine, which nothing outside your computer can
 * reach, and this script listens there for the one request. It shuts the server
 * the moment it has the token.
 *
 * The client id and secret come from the environment or from a .env file, so the
 * secret is never typed on a command line where a shell would remember it.
