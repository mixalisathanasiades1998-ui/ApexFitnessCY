/**
 * Copy the studio's database into Postgres, so it can be looked at.
 *
 *     npm run db:mirror              copy everything
 *     npm run db:mirror -- --dry     say what it would do, touch nothing
 *
 * ---
 *
 * **Why this exists.**
 *
 * The studio's database is a SQLite file on Render's persistent disk. That is
 * the right place for it: one machine, one writer, a few hundred members, and a
 * disk Render snapshots every night. What it is not is *visible*. Render's
 * dashboard has a perfectly good database browser and it only works for Render's
 * own Postgres, so the honest answer to "let me look at the bookings" was
 * `npm run db:peek` at a shell prompt, which is a fine tool and is not a table
 * you can click around in.
 *
 * So: leave the app exactly where it is, and copy the data somewhere that can be
 * browsed. Nothing in `src/` changes, no query is rewritten, and the live
 * database is opened read-only. If this script is deleted the website does not
 * notice.
 *
 * This is an ordinary arrangement rather than a workaround. Reporting replicas
 * exist because the database that takes the bookings and the database somebody
 * runs curious queries against want different things: the first wants to be left
 * alone, and the second wants to be poked at by a person who is guessing.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * **It is a copy, and it is one-way.**
 *
 * Every run drops the mirrored tables and rebuilds them. There is no attempt to
 * work out what changed, because a mirror that tries to be clever about deltas is
 * a mirror that will one day be subtly wrong, and a wrong copy is worse than no
 * copy. Rebuilding twenty small tables costs a second or two.
 *
 * Nothing here ever writes to SQLite, and nothing ever reads *back* from
 * Postgres. Anything typed into the mirror is gone on the next run, which is the
 * point: it means a mistyped `update` in Render's dashboard cannot cost the
 * studio a booking. The mirror is a photograph, not a second original.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * **Types get better on the way across, not worse.**
 *
 * SQLite stores a date as an integer count of seconds, which is why `db:peek`
 * shows `1757068200` where a person wanted `3 Sep 2026, 10:30`. Postgres has a
 * real timestamp type, so the mirror converts on the way in and the dashboard
 * shows dates as dates. Booleans stop being 0 and 1 for the same reason.
 *
 * Which columns are dates and which are flags is not guessed. It is read out of
 * `src/db/schema.ts`, the one place that already knows, so a column added there
 * tomorrow arrives in the mirror with the right type and nobody has to remember
 * this file exists. See `readModes()`.
